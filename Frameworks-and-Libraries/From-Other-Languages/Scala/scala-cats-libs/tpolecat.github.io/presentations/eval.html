# Agenda

- Announcements
- Short Beginner Talk
- Machine Learning with Robert Dodier

???

- rob
- WELCOME to pdxscala
- thanks for braving the weather

...

- we're always looking for speakers ... if you haven't ever given a talk but you're interested, please talk to me
  - experience reports
  - describe a problem you're having

- any other announcements or questions before we get started? this is a really informal meeting so if my talk goes off the rails and we decide to talk about something else, that's fine.

# Evaluation Models in Scala
Rob Norris / `@tpolecat`

???

- apologies for the formatting; i didn't have time to make it pretty
- this is a *beginner* talk, so pls pls interrupt me and ask questions
- how many totally new to scala?

# Evaluation Models in Scala

Has to do with **when**  (if ever) an expression is evaluated. 

Three main models:

- Eager
- Lazy
  - By Name
  - By Need

Scala supports all of these. All are useful.

???

- in **pure** code (so anything you write in haskell) you don't have to worry about the difference between by-name and by-need.
- in **total** code (which is pure code that always terminates) you don't have to worry about the difference at all.
- BUT in mainstream side-effecty code they're all different and the choice can change the behavior of your program. So it's important to understand what they mean.

...

So let's look at each of them.

# Eager Evaluation

Expression is evaluated when the variable is **bound**.

```scala
scala> val a = { println("*** EVAL ***"); 1 + 2 } // a block expression
*** EVAL ***
a: Int = 3

scala> a
res0: Int = 3

scala> a
res1: Int = 3
```

- Default in Scala and in in most other languages.

---

# Lazy Evaluation by **Name**

Expression is evaluated **always** when the value is **needed**.

```scala
scala> def a = { println("*** EVAL ***"); 1 + 2 }
a: Int

scala> a
*** EVAL ***
res2: Int = 3

scala> a
*** EVAL ***
res3: Int = 3
```

- Required if the expression is side-effecting.
- No equivalent in pure languages because there's no reason to evaluate anything more than once.
- In pure code you very rarely see a no-arg `def`.

---

# Lazy Evaluation by **Need**

Expression is evaluated **once** when the value is **needed**.

```scala
scala> lazy val a = { println("*** EVAL ***"); 1 + 2 }
a: Int = <lazy>

scala> a
*** EVAL ***
res4: Int = 3

scala> a
res5: Int = 3
```

- Default model in Haskell.
- Useful in Scala if a value might not be used.
- Useful for resolving initialization order problems.
- Beware side-effects (especially exceptions)!

???

... But there are other ways to introduce bindings!

# What about method parameters?

# Eager Evaluation

Argument is evaluated when the variable is **bound** (i.e., before the method body is entered).

```scala
scala> def foo(a: Int) = a + a
foo: (a: Int)Int

scala> foo { println("*** EVAL ***"); 1 + 2 }
*** EVAL ***
res6: Int = 6
```

- Default in Scala and in in most other languages.

---

# Lazy Evaluation by **Name**

Expression is evaluated **always** when the value is **needed**.

```scala
scala> def foo(a: => Int) = a + a
foo: (a: => Int)Int

scala> foo { println("*** EVAL ***"); 1 + 2 }
*** EVAL ***
*** EVAL ***
res7: Int = 6
```

- Useful when an argument needs to be evaluated *any* number of times.
- Required when the expression is side-effecting.
- Often used in by-need situations.

# Lazy Evaluation by **Need**

Expression is evaluated **once** when the value is **needed**.

```scala
scala> def foo(a0: => Int) = { lazy val a = a0; a + a }
foo: (a0: => Int)Int

scala> foo { println("*** EVAL ***"); 1 + 2 }
*** EVAL ***
res8: Int = 6
```

- Default model in Haskell.
- Useful if an argument might not be used.
- Often what you really want.
