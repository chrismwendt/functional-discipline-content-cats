<h3>about me</h3>

<p>My name is Rob and I live in Portland, Oregon with my wife Joanna, daughter Ada, and cat Chicken. I am interested in alpine climbing and functional programming, but not really done much climbing since Ada was born. I have also been eating a lot of cookies, so if you want to climb Nanga Parbat I will need some time to train first.</p>

<p>I write software for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gemini.edu">Gemini Observatory</a>, mostly involving tools that astronomers use to plan and execute science observations. It is a fun job, and I am <b>not</b> looking for work. If you are a recruiter please leave me alone.</p>

<p>The name <b>tpolecat</b> is borrowed from a friend of mine who always signed up for online stuff as Tangley Polecat to better identify spam, and several others of us followed suit. I was unsure when joining Twitter and other such things so I used the fake name and somehow it has stuck.</p>


<h3>contact</h3>

<p>If you wish to contact me, please find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tpolecat">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tpolecat">GitHub</a> or on IRC (the <code>#scala</code> channel on FreeNode is a good bet). I am not on LinkedIn or Facebook.</p>
