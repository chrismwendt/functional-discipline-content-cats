Catalysts is an intentionally small library of small modules to help build and test platform independent Scala projects with SBT.

### Maintainers

The current maintainers (people who can merge pull requests) are:

 * [adelbertc](https://github.com/adelbertc) Adelbert Chang
 * [ochrons](https://github.com/ochrons) Otto Chrons
 * [BennyHill](https://github.com/BennyHill) Alistair Johnson
 * [non](https://github.com/non) Erik Osheim
 * [milessabin](https://github.com/milessabin) Miles Sabin

We are currently following a practice of requiring at least two
sign-offs to merge PRs (and for large or contentious issues we may
wait for more). For typos or other small fixes to documentation we
relax this to a single sign-off.
