People are expected to follow the
[Scala Code of Conduct](https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/) when
discussing Catalysts on the Github page, Gitter channel, or other
venues.

We hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If
you find yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or
that fails to live up to our expectations, you should disengage and
contact one of the [project maintainers](README.md#maintainers) in private. We
hope to avoid letting minor aggressions and misunderstandings escalate
into larger problems.

If you are being harassed, please contact one of [us](README.md#maintainers)
immediately so that we can support you.
