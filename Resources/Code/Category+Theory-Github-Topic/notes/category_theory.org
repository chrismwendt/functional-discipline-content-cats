* Jargon
** TODO Object
** TODO Algebraic structure
** Morphism
A structure-preserving map from one mathematical /object/ to another.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In category theory, obey conditions specific to category theory itself.
#+END_QUOTE
** Homomorphism
A structure-preserving map between two /algebraic structures/ of the same type.
** Isomorphism
A /homomorphism/ or /morphism/ that admits an /inverse/.
Two /objects/ are /isomorphic/ if an /isomorphism/ exists between them.
** Automorphism
An /isomorphism/ from a mathematical /object/ to itself,
i.e. an invertible /endomorphism/.
** Endomorphism
A /morphism/ (or /homomorphism/) from a mathematical /object/ to itself.
** Epimorphism
Also known as an /epic morphism/, or an /epi/. A /morphism/, $f: X \to Y$ that
is /right-cancellative/ i.e.
\[
  \forall g_1, g_2: Y \to Z,
  \ g_1 \circ f = g_2 \circ f \implies g_1 = g_2
\]

/Epimorphisms/ are /categorical/ analogues of /surjective/ /functions/.
** TODO Right-cancellative
** Surjective
"onto"
\[
  f : X \to Y,
  \ \forall y \in Y,\ \exists x \in X,\ f(x) = y
\]
** Monomorphism
An /injective/ /homomorphism/, e.g. $X \hookrightarrow Y$. In /category theory/,
a /monomorphism/ (a.k.a /monic morphism/ or /mono/) is a /left-cancellative/
/morphism/, i.e.
\[
  \forall g_1, g_2 : Z \to X,
  \ f : X \to Y\ s.t.\ f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2 \implies g_1 = g_2
\]

/Monomorphisms/ are a /categorical/ generalization of /injective/ /functions/
** TODO Left-cancellative
** Injective
"one-to-one"
\[
  \forall a, b \in X,\ f(a) = f(b) \implies  a = b
\]
/contrapositive/:
\[
  \forall a, b \in X,\ a \neq b \implies f(a) \neq f(b)
\]
** Category
An /algebraic structure/ comprised of /objects/ linked by /arrows/,
e.g. the /category/ of /sets/, which links /sets/ with /functions/.
/Arrows/ can be composed /associatively/ and there exists an /identity/ /arrow/.
** TODO Set
** TODO Function
** TODO Associativity
** TODO Identity
** TODO Abelian category
A /category/ in which /morphisms/ and /objects/ can be added and in which
/kernels/ and /cokernels/ exist and have desireable properties, e.g. the
/category of abelian groups/, *Ab*.
- has a /zero object/
- has all binary /products/ and binary /coproducts/
- has all /kernels/ and /cokernels/
- all /monomorphisms/ and /epimorphisms/ are /normal/
** TODO Group
** TODO Ab
The category of abelian groups.
** Zero object
An /object/ that is both /intial/ and /terminal/.
a.k.a. /null object/.
** Pointed category
A /category/ with a /zero object/.
** Strict initial object
An /initial object/ for which every /morphism/ into $I$ is an /isomorphism/.
** Initial object
$I \in C, \forall X \in C \exists$ precisely one /morphism/ $I \to X$
a.k.a. /coterminal/ or /universal/
** Terminal object
$T$ is /terminal/ if $\forall X \in C \exists$ a single /morphism/ $X \to T$.
a.k.a /terminal element/
** Product
The "most general" /object/ which admits a /morphism/ to each of the given
/objects/.
