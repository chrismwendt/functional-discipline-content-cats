1. def identity(x): x
2. def compose(g, f): (lambda x): g(f(x))
3. compose(f, identity)(5) = 
4. Hyperlinks are not morphisms, the web is a category if you relax the arrows
   so that they are the transitive closure of hyperlinks, that is a morphism
   between two web pages exists if and only if there is a series of zero or more
   hyperlinks that lead from one web page to another.
5. Again, no it's not, unless you take the transitive closure of friendships
6. A directed graph is a category where the nodes are objects and edges
   morphisms if and only if the transitive closure of all edges holds again
