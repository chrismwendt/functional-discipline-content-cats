# Hi, didn't expect to see you here !
But hey, now that you are here, check out the two pdfs in the root directory why don't you ? I promise they're nothing scary.

This repo contains stuff from final semester of undergrad at SNU, pertaining to a course in analysis and my undergraduate thesis. The latter was about understanding, and then writing the paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864111002525 in a more approachable format. It instead ended up skipping the last section.

TL;DR This repo is here as a testament to the beating that quality takes when doing stuff at the eleventh hour. If you still want to read,
look no further than the two PDFs in the root directory.
