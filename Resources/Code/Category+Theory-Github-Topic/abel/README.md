Category Theory Applied to Functional Programming
=================================================

This is the code for (Villa Isaza 2014), in which we study some of the
applications of category theory to functional programming,
particularly in the context of the Haskell functional programming
language, and the Agda dependently typed functional programming
language and proof assistant.

The Haskell code was tested with GHC 7.6.3. Most of it corresponds to
or is based on standard Haskell code, and can be used as it is. See
`src/Cain.hs`.

The Agda code was tested with:

- Agda 2.3.2.2 and the Agda standard library 0.7
- Agda 2.5.1.1 and the Agda standard library 0.12

See `src/Abel.agda`.
