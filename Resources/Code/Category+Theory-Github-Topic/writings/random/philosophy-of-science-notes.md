# Philosophy of Science: Notes

*  Degrees of empericism
    -  personal empericism: I trust only in what I experience
    -  more modest empericism: I trust in the things that people I trust experience. This connects more to the social aspect of science.

*  Book reference: Science Without Numbers by Hartry Field
*  Carnap: how to logically and rigorously construct the understanding of the world from our senses.
*  analytic vs syntetic
    -  analytic: If we understand the non-logical words, we can decide the truth of the statement. Comes from Kant. E.g. All bachelors are married.
    -  synthetic: One needs to know more than just the meanings in order to determine truth, i.e. one needs information from the world (emperical). E.g. Some bachelors are bald.
    -  Mathematical truths are analytic (because *history* and *meaning*)
*  propositions vs sentences: propositions are semantic, whereas sentences are syntactic.
*  Questions about metaphysics, God, religion, etc. have no *cognitive content*, and hence are not worth discussing.
*  Emotivism a.k.a. hurrah/boo theory
    -  The poor should be helped ≡ Help the poor! Hurrah!
    -  Killing babies is bad ≡ Killing babies, boo!
*  Language
    -  Theoretical: 'Gravity' is in a sense embedded in the theory. We cannot directly *observe* gravity.
*  Deductive vs inductive logic
    -  deductive: the conclusions follow from the premises by *necessity*.
    -  inductive: the conclusions follow from the premises with something less than *necessity*.
*  Section 5 Two Dogmas of Empericism by Quine
    -  Science is a systematic body of beliefs, and there are beliefs in the interior and others in the exterior.
    -  There must be enough material in the interior (i.e. enough theoretical strength) for us to be able to reach the exterior (i.e. be observable).
    -  This essentially implies that analytic truths are parasitic on synthetic truths.
*  Logical positivism vs logical empericism: Logical positivism is reductist in a very strict sense. Strict reduction of theoretical claims to observational claims via sensations and logic. The word 'reducibility' was given by Carnap.
*  Three types on non-deductive inference: (TODO)
    -  1
    -  2
    -  3
*  Hypothetico-deductivism: theory *T* ⟹ observations *O_1, …, O_n*
*  Problems with hypothetico-deductivism:
    -  *T*: there are Gods ⟹ *T* or *S*, where *S*: water is wet. So essentially we can observe *S* and conclude *T* is true.
    -  We need auxillary hypotheses to derive something observable.
*  *Observation* is typically used to denote sensations inherent to the individual, so that would exclude spectacles, binoculars, telescopes, etc. The term we typically use in these cases is *determination*.
*  *Disposition*: Talking about things that we predict will happen for certain. E.g. "solubility": If I put sugar in water, it will desolve.
