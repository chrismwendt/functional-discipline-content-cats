    abstract = {We introduce a new class of stochastic processes, called near-martingales, which arise in the study of a new stochastic integral defined by Ayed and Kuo. We obtain a special version of the Itô isometry for this new stochastic integral of certain instantly independent stochastic processes. We also prove a formula that allows us to express the new integral in terms of the classical Itô and Riemann integrals.}}
