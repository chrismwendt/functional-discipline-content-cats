\startchapter [title={Introduction and revision}]
	
	In the first two days we will review what we learned in Combinatorics 1 and try to solve interesting problems related to them.

	The structure of the course is going to be as follows (the ordered pair represents (week, day)):
	\startitemize [m, joinedup]
		\item[w1d1]  (week 1, day 1)  Revision of counting
			\startitemize [a, joinedup]
				\item  what is combinatorics?
				\item  addition and multiplication rules (+ proofs)
				\item  permutations and combinations
				\item  binomial and multinomial coefficients and theorem
				\item  proofs using combinatorial methods
				\item  proofs of basic results
			\stopitemize

		\item[w2d2]  (week 1, day 2)
			\startitemize [a, joinedup]
				\item  Multinomial type problems
				\item  Revision of graph theory
				\item
				\item
			\stopitemize
		  
		\item[w1d3]  (week 1, day 3)
		\item[w1d4]  (week 1, day 4)

		\item[w2d1]  (week 2, day 1)
		\item[w2d2]  (week 2, day 2)
		\item[w2d3]  (week 2, day 3)
