		\startexercise [title={Monty Hall}]
			Suppose you‚Äôre on a game show, and you‚Äôre given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say number 1, and the host, who knows what‚Äôs behind the doors, opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat. He says to you, \quotation{Do you want to switch to door number 2?} Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of the door?

			\startitemize [n, joinedup]
				\item  no
				\item  yes
				\item  switching is irrelevant and does not change anything

		\startexercise [title={strange dice}]
			There are three dice, \m{A}, \m{B}, and \m{C}. The dice are numbered \emph{strangely}, as shown below:
			\startitemize [A, joinedup]
				\item  2, 6, 7
				\item  1, 5, 9
				\item  3, 4, 8
			\stopitemize
			with the numbers on opposite faces being the same.

			The rules are simple. You pick one of the three dice, and then I pick one of the two remainders. We both roll and the player with the higher number wins. Which die do you choose?

		\startexercise [title={Bertrand's box}]
			There are three boxes. Each box contains two coins, which can be either gold(\m{G}) or silver(\m{S}). Their composition is as follows:
			\startitemize [A, joinedup]
				\item  \m{G}, \m{G}
				\item  \m{G}, \m{S}
				\item  \m{S}, \m{S}
			\stopitemize
			After choosing a box at random, you pick a coin, and find that it is a \m{G}. What is the probability that the next coin is also a \m{G}?
			
			\bold{Choose one}:
			\startitemize [n, joinedup]
				\item  \m{\frac13}
				\item  \m{\frac12}
				\item  \m{\frac23}
				\item  none of the above

		\startexercise [title={Bulb factory}]
			Suppose that two factories supply light bulbs to the market. Factory X's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 99\% of cases, whereas factory Y's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 95\% of cases. It is known that factory X supplies 60\% of the total bulbs available and Y supplies 40\% of the total bulbs available. What is the chance that a purchased bulb will work for longer than 5000 hours?

		\startexercise [title={Law of total probability}]
			Let \m{E_1, E_2, ‚ãØ, E_n} is a mutually exclusive and exhaustive set of events, that is,
			\startitemize [1, joinedup]
				\item  (\emph{mutually exclusive})  \m{E_i ‚à© E_j = ‚àÖ} for every combination of \m{i} and \m{j}, and
				\item  (\emph{exhaustive})  \m{E_1 ‚äî E_2 ‚äî ‚ãØ ‚äî E_n = Œ©}.
			\stopitemize
			If \m{F} is an event, then prove that
			\startformula
				‚Ñô(F)  =  ‚àë_{i = 1}^n \bsqr{‚Ñô(F ‚à£ E_i) ‚Ñô(E_i)} .

		\startexercise [title={Bayes formula}]
			Use the \emph{law of total probability} to prove the Bayes formula
			\startformula
				‚Ñô(E ‚à£ F) = \frac{‚Ñô(F ‚à£ E) ‚Ñô(E)}{‚Ñô(F ‚à£ E) ‚Ñô(E) + ‚Ñô(F ‚à£ E^‚àÅ) ‚Ñô(E^‚àÅ)} .

		\startexercise [title={Blood test}]
			A blood test for the HIV is developed.
			When the virus is present, it reports positive with a probability of 99\%.
			When the virus is absent, it reports negative with a probability of 99\%.
			By 2017 estimates, 0.5\% of the world population is infected.
			What is the probability that a person whose test results come out positive is infected?

		\startexercise [title={Mutual and pairwise independence}]
			Two events \m{A} and \m{B} are called independent if \m{‚Ñô(A ‚à© B) = ‚Ñô(A) ‚ãÖ ‚Ñô(B)}.
			Three events are called \emph{pairwise} independent if every two events are independent.
			Three events \m{A}, \m{B}, and \m{C} are called \emph{mutually} independent if \m{‚Ñô(A ‚à© B ‚à© C) = ‚Ñô(A) ‚ãÖ ‚Ñô(B) ‚ãÖ ‚Ñô(C)}.

			If the events \m{A}, \m{B}, and \m{C} are pairwise independent, does it mean that they are mutually independent?
			If yes, argue why. If no, try to find a counterexample.

		\startexercise [title={Mutual and pairwise independence}]
			We throw two dice. Let \m{A} be the event ‚Äúthe sum of the points is 7‚Äù, \m{B} the event ‚Äúfirst die came up 3‚Äù, and \m{C} the event ‚Äúsecond die came up 4‚Äù.
			\startitemize [m, joinedup]
				\item  Calculate \m{‚Ñô(A)}, \m{‚Ñô(B)}, and \m{‚Ñô(C)}.
				\item  Calculate \m{‚Ñô(A ‚à© B)}, \m{‚Ñô(B ‚à© C)}, and \m{‚Ñô(C ‚à© A)}. Are the three events pairwise independent?
				\item  Calculate \m{‚Ñô(A ‚à© B ‚à© C)}. Are the three events mutually independent?
				\item  What is the moral of the story?

		\startexercise [title={Betting}]
			Three balls are selected randomly without replacement from an urn containing 20 balls numbered 1 through 20. I bet that I win if if the maximum number is at least 17 (or more). What is the probability that I win?

			\comment{Hint}: Let \m{X} denote the maximum number among the drawn balls. What is \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X ‚â• 17}}?

		\startexercise [title={\emph{Binomial} random variables}]
			Jonathan tosses 7 \emph{unfair} coins simultaneously. He know that each coin turns up heads two out of three times on average. He wants to know the probability of getting \m{k} heads for different values of \m{k}. He expresses the problem as follows:

			Let \m{p} be the probability of turning up heads for each coin, so \m{p = \frac23}.

			Let \m{X} be the number of heads in the experiment. Then \m{X} can vary from 0 to 7. We want to compute \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = k}} for each value of k.

			Help Jonathan fill up the table.
			\startitemize [1, joinedup, columns]
				\item  \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = 0} = }
				\item  \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = 1} = }
				\item  \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = 2} = }
				\item  \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = 3} = }
				\item  \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = 4} = }
				\item  \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = 5} = }
				\item  \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = 6} = }
				\item  \m{‚Ñô\bcrl{X = 7} = }
			\stopitemize

			Having done all this work, Jonathan now wants to calculate the \emph{mean} of \m{X}. How can he do it?

			\comment{Hint}: The mean is the weighted average of the values attained by \m{X}, where the weights are now the probabilities.
			
			\blank[4*big]

			Now, he asks himself if he could have done this without resorting to so much work. Could he?
