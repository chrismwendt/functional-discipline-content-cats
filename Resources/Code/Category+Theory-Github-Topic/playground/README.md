# Alf's playground

This repository is merely a playground I use while reading
Bartosz Milewski's [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
and
Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason's [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)

Expect to see here a total mess of the unfinished exercises and random ideas. Any feedback is welcome, in the issues or by email.

Above all, have fun.

Alexey
