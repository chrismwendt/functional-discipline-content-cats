**I had this little anecdote hiding in my notes and thought it deserved some limelight. Most of it was an improvised interpretation that my friend Rickard Lund came up with, when I taught him the basics of functional programming and mentioned professor Haskell Curry (which he thought sounded like a potential Bond villain).**

**Bond:** "Do you expect me to talk?"

**Professor H. Curry:** "Oh ho ho no Mr. Bond, I expect you to compose... or rather, de-compose."

**Bond:** "You're insane! You can't destroy all of the United States!"

**Professor H. Curry:** "Oh no Mr. Bond, you misunderstand. I was talking about the states in your crappy imperative code. Those are what I will destroy."

**Bond:** "It'll never work! Your plan has too many variables!"

**Professor H. Curry:** "On the contrary Mr. Bond. Variables are exactly what I don't have."
