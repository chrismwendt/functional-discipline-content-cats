**This is not my first attempt at blogging and I think my previous efforts died out because of a lack of purpose and value. After a time of pondering I have found my mission and this will be my way of sharing the journey with you.**

For a long time I thought that imperative and object oriented programming was the best path for a software professional. But after stumbling into functional programming I began to change my mind as I learned more and more of the functional idioms. Now in retrospect I know that all the good features that are being added to existing object oriented programming languages have their origin in functional ones.

Then I heard about Bret Victor in James Somers article [The Coming Software Apocalypse](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/) and watched his talks [Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII), [The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4&t=923s) and [Stop Drawing Dead Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfytHvgHybA). I also came in contact with interesting languages such as [Eve](http://play.witheve.com/), [Luna](https://www.luna-lang.org/) the visual programming language and the knowledge based programming language [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/). Not to mention the vast amount of programming paradigms that exist beyond the ones that most of us know of.

There is no denying that there is a huge world outside of our little bubble that is todays software industry and I cannot shake off the feeling that we might have strayed away from the path that we should be on.

So basically that is what I want to do with Chris Unleashed. To dig deeper into the tried and proved paths, but also examine and praise those that diverged, the ideas that were too obscure and way ahead of their time.
