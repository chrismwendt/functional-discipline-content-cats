The name's Chris Sundberg and I am a software developer currently working for Sigma ITC. Where I mostly do Java or Front End development.
I am passionate about learning and teaching and therefore I started [OpenSourceBySigma](https://sigmaitc.github.io) where we provide currated lists based around our technical departments. We want to provide a road map of necessary and interesting tools and technologies so that we have a clear path ahead of us while we improve on our individual skills. The next step in this journey is to create a formal program for continuously developing our skills and learn mission critical technologies.

This is where this new blog comes in. I was honored with the assignment of making this development program and like OpenSourceBySigma I think it is important to share knowledge with the entire software community. Therefore I am combining this role with my personal venture to share my findings. At first this will only be a blog, but my hopes are to make a YouTube series where I present and discuss interesting topics that do not get the attention that they deserve.

Also read my first post [Introducing Chris Unleashed](/chrisunleashed/2018/08/26/intro.html) to better understand what inspires me.
