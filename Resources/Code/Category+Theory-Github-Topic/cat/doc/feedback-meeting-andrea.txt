App. 2 in HoTT gives typing rule for pathJ including a computational
rule for it.

If you have this computational rule definitionally, then you wouldn't
need to use `pathJprop`.

In discussion-section I mention HITs. I should remove this or come up
with a more elaborate example of something you could do, e.g.
something with pushouts in the category of sets.
