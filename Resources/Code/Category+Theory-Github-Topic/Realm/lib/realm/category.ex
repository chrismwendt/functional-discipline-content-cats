defprotocol Realm.Category do
  @moduledoc """
  A category is some collection of objects and relationships (morphisms) between them.
  This idea is captured by the notion of an identity function for objects,
  and the ability to compose relationships between objects. In most cases,
  these are very straightforward, and composition and identity are the standard
  functions from the `Quark` package or similar.
  ## Type Class
  An instance of `Realm.Category` must also implement `Realm.Semigroupoid`,
  and define `Realm.Category.identity/1`.
      Semigroupoid  [compose/2, apply/2]

       Category     [identity/1]
