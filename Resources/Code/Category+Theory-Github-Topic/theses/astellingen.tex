\begin{enumerate}
\item
Von Neumann algebras
though 80 years old
need not be replaced.
\item
A key to positivity is inversion --- both in  $C^*$-algebras,
and in life.
\item
Coalgebraists might find a use
for  descriptive set theory.
\item
    The subcategory $\textbf{haW}^*_\text{\textsc{cpsu}}$
        of~$\textbf{W}^*_\text{\textsc{cpsu}}$ from
        \textsf{84b\,II}
        is not closed under the
         Paschke dilations from \textsf{140\,III}.

%\item
%The theory of von Neumann algebras
%can be developed without mentioning
%the spectral theorem.
\item
We should limit what is to be considered personal data
lest it inevitably dilutes to the point
that the  GDPR becomes absurd.
\item
AlphaStar
        (Google's artificial 
        StarCraft II player)
shows masterfully calibrated
intuition, but no reason.
%\item
%Artificial intelligence will  mental illnesses, just like us.
%\item
%Breadth, not consistency, is a sign of truth;
%quite the opposite.
%\item
%Von Neumann algebras form a model of the quantum lambda calculus.
%\item
%The sequential product can be axiomatised in the category of von Neumann
%algebras.
%\item
%Forceful optimism
%invites prevarication, silence,
%and their pal, decay.
%\item
%Mediocrity is sticky.
%\item
%Taking offence where none was intended
%is either just foolish\dots{} or cruel.
%\item
%A tragedy:
%IQ is distributed normally,
%but success is not.
%\item
%There's more to gardening
%than adding and crossbreeding exciting new species.
%We scholars should take note.
\item
Dissection kills the animal;
analysis kills the concept.
%\item
%Lies betray themselves by their
%unnatural consistency.
%\item
%For all practical purposes
%magic is a placeholder for better
%articulated understanding.
%\item
%The fabric
%of reality,
%like the fabric of people,
%bares no blame.
%\item
%In highly civilised society
%there isn't quite enough serious input
%for our hard-wired ``knight program'',
%but the ``knave program'' comes along just fine.
