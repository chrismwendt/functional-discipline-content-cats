(ii) references which mention pre-publication versions may be updated to
final bibliographic form.
</p>
<p>
In the case of any change under (i) or (ii), the originally posted article
will be replaced with a dated revision that refers to the change. The
originally posted version of the article will also be maintained by the
journal with a link on its web site.

<p>
The final accepted version of an article will be
permanently maintained in the archive without change, except as
follows:<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>TAC Erratum or Correction Procedures</b>
</p>

<ol>

<li> For a small correction in an article (or the appending of a short
erratum) that does not affect pagination, TAC will replace the posted
article with a new version. The new version will have a footnote on the
article first page giving its posting date. Any previous version will
remain accessible by a link on the article's web abstract page.
</li>

<li> If an author requests a change to their originally posted article
that would affect pagination, TAC will post an erratum or correction as a
separate number in the current annual volume. TAC will replace the
originally posted article with a new version. The new version will have a
footnote on the article first page giving its posting date, and a
forward reference to the separately posted erratum. Any previous version
will remain accessible by a link on the article's web abstract
page. That page will also contain a forward link to the erratum.
</li>

<li> If the Managing Editor judges it advisable, the erratum or correction
may be submitted to the original Transmitting Editor.
</li>

<li> A substantive change under 1. or new number published under 2. will
be announced to the subscriber list.

<h3>
FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION
</h3>

<p>
It is the author's responsibility to provide the
transmitting editor with a compiled (pdf) version of an
article.<br>
<b>The Editors require final submissions to be formatted with LaTeX 2e AND use the <a href="style/tac.cls">
tac.cls</a> style file (new for 2020!).</b> <br>
Source code which does not meet these conditions will be
returned to the author for revision.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Please note first:
</b>
<ol>

<li>
TAC uses a <b>12 point</b> style. You must compose your article
at that size.
</li>

<li>
It will assist the editors if
authors ensure that their files use lines of limited length,
preferably no more than 72 characters.
</li>


<li>
An article will be published <b><i>only in the journal's
style</i></b>.  Authors must submit source code
which uses the
<i>
<a href="style/tac.cls">
tac.cls
</a>
</i>
style file (see item 8. below for a sample using this style).
<b><i>
Do not modify the TAC class file. Author macros which interfere
with the journal style will be deleted.</i></b> Authors must take
account of this in submitting TeXscripts. For example, the amsthm
package is incompatible with the journal's style since it changes
proclamations.

<li>
<b>Do not alter the page dimensions.</b> That includes not changing
\textwidth,\textheight, etc. Do not load a package, such as the geometry
package, that does it for you.
</li>

</li>

<li>

Articles are published in pdf format only.  TAC uses PdfLaTeX to typeset
articles. Ensure that your source compiles with PdfLaTeX.  Graphics may be
included. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that <i>category theory
diagrams are composed with a macro package</i> noted in the Source File
Checklist, item 3.  below.

</li>

<li>
To accommodate external indexing, <b>you must include at least one <a href="https://zbmath.org/classification/">AMS
2020 Subject Classification</a> </b> and a <i>few</i> <b>keywords</b> in your
source file.
</li>


<li>
The TAC style uses the hyperref package to create links to citations and
internal references. Reference links work only if <tt>\label</tt>'s are
used. Links are coloured a dark blue without boxing.
Authors may introduce external links, but
<i>they are deprecated because of their impermanence. </i>
External links will not be revised.
</li>

<li>
<b>
Example <i>TAC</i> source file:
</b>
A source file illustrating use of the
author version
<i>
<a href="style/tac.cls">
tac.cls
</a>
</i>
of the journal's style is called
<i>
<a href="style/sample.tex">
sample.tex.
</a>
</i>
Its compiled version is
<i>
<a href="style/sample.pdf">
sample.pdf.
</a>
</i>
<!--Using tac.cls before final submission
of an article will greatly reduce the delay from acceptance to
publication, and the editors reserve the right to return source code
composed in other formats.-->
</li>

<li>
Be sure to comply with <b>all</b> items in the
<b>
Source File Checklist
</b>
below.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>
Brief hints for using
<i>
<a href="style/tac.cls">
tac.cls
</a>
</i>
</b>
<br>
The style for <i>Theory and Applications of Categories</i> is
based on the LaTeX article class. It was created by
Michael Barr and TAC authors. Thus, your LaTeX source code
using tac.cls will be nearly identical
to code you would produce in using the article class. The few
exceptions concern the title, abstract, proclamation of theorems,
propositions etc., and the references.
<i>
For more detail on the points below, especially if you
are submitting your source code to <i>TAC</i>
for the first time, <b>please</b> look at the items
following the Source File Checklist.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Title and abstract:</i>
<br>
The title of the paper and of sections should be typeset
with the first letter capitalized and no other caps except for proper
names.
There are several required macros which are similar to those of LaTeX
article style:
<br>
\title, \author, \address, \eaddress, \keywords, \amsclass
<br>
You may use multiple author names and addresses. Use \\ to obtain a new
line; \amsclass refers to the <a href="https://zbmath.org/classification/">AMS 2020 Subject Classification</a>.  You may use square brackets in the title argument to denote a running title separate from the full title of the paper.

Optional title macros are
<br>
\thanks, \dedication
<br>
Please note that \thanks is not part of \author (in contrast to the
article class.)
</p><p>
Remember that the macros above should be in the preamble (that is, before
\begin{document}). They are called by \maketitle which must immediately
follow \begin{document}.
</p>
<p>

The text of your abstract must immediately follow \maketitle and begin
with \begin{abstract} and end with
\end{abstract}. Because the abstract will be rendered in html on the
journal's web pages, it is strongly recommended that use of
<i>mathematical symbols in the abstract is minimized.</i>
Citations in the abstract will be
deleted when it appears on the journal's web page. In any case, an
abstract should never include citations - it is meant to be available and
readable independently of the article.

</p>
<p>
<i>Proclamations and proofs:</i>
<br>
<b>Do not</b> use hand-coded formatting commands, such as forced line
or page breaks, nor forced vertical or horizontal spacing.
<b>Do</b> use standard latex
environments (e.g., theorem-like environments, sub-sectioning commands,
enumerate or itemize environements).

In TAC style, proclamations are handled using the \subsection counters and
you should <i>always use</i> \label's to ensure correct internal
references. The macros for proclamations come in
pairs, for example
<br>
\theorem, \endtheorem
<br>
Pre-defined macro pairs are available for:
<br>
\theorem, \proposition, \corollary, \lemma, \definition, \remark, \example
<br>
The latter <i>two</i> macros result in roman type, not italic.
In TAC style definitions are set in italic.
See below for adding your own proclamation names.
<!--
You may abbreviate, for example
<br>
\let\thm\theorem <br>
\let\endtheorem\eth <br>
<br>
-->
</p>
<p>
The text of proofs should begin with \proof, and end with \endproof
(the latter provides a `Halmos bar'.)
</p>
<p>
<i>References</i><br>

The reference list environment begins with <br>

\begin{references} or \begin{references*} <br>

depending on whether the Harvard e.g. [Eileberg-Mac Lane, 1945] or a
numerical reference style is desired.

<!--You may substitute
<br>
\references, \references*
<br>
closed with \endreferences(*) for the environment declaration.
-->
</p>
<p>
Finally, the class file has some very useful macros for dealing with
new math operations, math roman elements like `hom' and multi-line
displays. See the documentation below, or in the class file.

</p>
<h3>
Source File Checklist
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
A TeX source file and a compiled pdf must be sent to the Managing Editor
after acceptance.

<p>
</li>

<li>
The source file <b>must begin with a comment</b> which includes the
following information:<br>
the number of pages, any diagram macro package
used, any non-standard fonts, the implementation of TeX used in preparation
of the source file. An example is
<p>
<code>
% 12 pp, Xy-pic ver 3.9, MikTeX version 3.2
</code>
<p>
</li>

<li>The source file must use the style file <a href="style/tac.cls">tac.cls</a>.
<p>
</li>


<li>
The source code for an article <b>must</b> be submitted as a
<b>single</b> source file and include the bibliography.
For example, authors must not submit a separate .bbl file.

<p>
<b>
<i>All</i> author macros must be included <i>at the beginning of the
source file.</i>
</b>
Any macro that is <b>not actually used
<i>should be deleted</i></b> from the source file. Packages used should be
loaded at the beginning of the source file.
Do not use \def in your personal macros. Use \newcommand or \renewcommand,
instead.

</p>

<p>
The exception to including macros is
<a href="#diagram"> diagram macro
</a>
<a name="diagramreturn"> packages.</a>
The preferred diagram macro packages are those authored by
Rose and Moore (xypic) and Michael Barr (diagxy macros for xypic). For
visual reasons we prefer native xypic or diagxy to the xymatrix package.
See <a href="style/diagxy-xymatrix.pdf">diagxy-xymatrix.pdf</a>
for a consideration of the differences.
The author is responsible to ensure that the current version of
a macro package has been used.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<li>
Articles <b>must</b> include an <b>Abstract</b> in English of not more
than 200 words. Because the abstract will be rendered in html on the
journal's web pages, it is strongly recommended that use of mathematical
symbols in the abstract be minimized. Citations in the abstract will be
deleted when it appears on the journal's web page. An abstract should
never include citations in any case - it is meant to be available and
readable independently of the article.


<p></p>

<li>
<b><a href="https://zbmath.org/classification/">AMS 2020 Subject Classification</a> </b> and a few
<b>keywords</b> must be included with the source file.
<p>
</li>

<a name="fonts"></a>
<h3>Fonts</h3>
<p>
Authors should note that the <b>base font size</b> is 12 point.
Avoid use of elements which depend on
another base font size. This is another reason to
<b>avoid absolute moves</b> such as `\vskip 10 pt'.
Remember that the journal's pagination will differ from yours.
As a general rule less, but more logical,  formatting is better.
</p>
<p>
Authors are
<em>
<b>strongly</b>
</em>
encouraged to use only fonts from the
standard TeX distribution (cmr etc.), AMS symbol fonts (msym...) or the
Xy-pic fonts. They should be aware that use of
<b>non-standard fonts can
interfere with successful dissemination</b> of their work.
</p>


<a name="sourcestyle"></a>
<h3>Source file style</h3>
<p>
<b>
LaTeX 2e is the required format.
</b>
Non-LaTeX 2e source code will be returned to the author for
revision. <!--If not using TAC style, <b>do use a 12 point style file</b>.-->
</p>

<p>
The LaTeX 2e class file for TAC authors is
<i>
<a href="style/tac.cls">
tac.cls.
</a>
</i>
<!--Using this class before final submission
of an article will greatly reduce the delay from acceptance to publication.-->
</p>

<h4>
Logical formatting
</h4>

<p>
The most important
advice for a <i>TAC</i> author (or for any electronic journal,
or even any journal that accepts TeXscripts) is to
<i>use logical, rather than physical formatting.</i>
That is, instead of beginning a section by writing
<pre><code>
\medskip
\noindent{\bf 4.3 The main theorem.}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
just write
</p>
<pre><code>
\section{The main theorem}\label{mainth}
</code></pre>
<p>
(The \label will be explained below.)  Instead of writing
</p>
<pre><code>
\smallskip
\noindent{\sc Theorem A}{\it ...}
</code></pre>
<p>
write
</p>
<pre><code>
\begin{theorem}\label{thmA} ... \end{theorem}
</code></pre>
<p>
(shorter forms as will be explained later).
</p>
<p>
You should <i>never</i> put explicit skips and kerns into your paper.
Suppose, for example, you want to go on to a new topic and want to leave
a little space.  The preferable way is to write
<pre><code>
\subsubsection*{}
</code></pre>
<p>
which will have exactly that effect.  In fact, it is probably always
appropriate to start a new subsection in such a case.  Except
in very long papers, we discourage the use of three indexing levels.
<p>
<p>
<em>
The point is to use symbolic formatting and let the journals put in
their own style.
</em>
<p>
All versions of LaTeX provide definitions for \section, \subsection, and
\subsubsection.  It even goes further, but these should be enough for
nearly all papers.  They do not provide definitions for \begin{theorem}
and the like.  But the <em>TAC</em> style files provide
a \newtheorem macro that
is used as follows.  Place at the beginning of your paper, the
following:
<pre><code>
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}
 ... (whatever is needed)
</code></pre>
<p>
The first parameter is what you will call it in your TeXscript and the
second what it will be called in your paper.  So you can just as well
write
</p>
<pre><code>
\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
...
</code></pre>
<p>
and then you can enclose your theorems in \begin{thm}...\end{thm} or
even \thm...\endthm.  Beware that you lose certain error checking with the
latter form.
Note that the text of proclamations is usually set in emphasized (italic)
type but roman text can be obtained using the \newtheoremrm macro. Examples
of this usage are the predefined \remark and \example macros.
</p>


<!-- Revised this far 2017-12-14 -->
<p>
A theorem (or any theorem-like environment), whether introduced by
\theorem or by \begin{theorem} may have an optional argument that is
material to be set in upright font and enclosed in square brackets.
This is normally used to give credit, but may also be used for naming
the theorem.  For example,
</p>

<pre><code>
\theorem[Fermat's last theorem] For any integers ...\endtheorem
</code></pre>
<p>
will result in
</p>

<pre><code>
THEOREM [Fermat's last theorem] For any integers ...
</code></pre>

<p>
and
</p>

<pre><code>
\theorem[Fermat's last theorem \cite{w94}] For any integers
...\endtheorem
</code></pre>

<p>
might result in
</p>

<pre><code>
THEOREM [Fermat's last theorem [Wiles, 1994]] For any integers ...
</code></pre>

<p>
A few points should be noted.  If the parenthetical material
itself contains brackets, then it must be enclosed in braces.  For
example,
</p>

<pre><code>
\theorem[Fermat's last theorem {\cite[Theorem 4.7]{w94}}] For any
integers ...\endtheorem
</code></pre>

<p>
will result in only one pair of brackets in the output, not two.
Nothing (in particular no \label) may intervene between \theorem or
\begin{theorem} and this parenthetical remark.  A \label can follow this
argument with no change in functionality.
</p>

<p>

TAC uses the <tt>\subsection</tt> counter to assign numbering to proclaimed items (like definitions
and theorem statements).  Thus they, and numbered subsections, are numbered sequentially within a
section. Some authors may prefer numbering of proclaimed items within a subsection, and for this
the <tt>\thirdleveltheorems</tt> macro is available.  For the (usually short) articles without
sections, authors may use <tt>\firstlevel theorems</tt>.

</p>


<h4>Multi-character identifiers</h4>

<p>
All TeX users should be aware that it is absolutely standard in
mathematical typography that single characters should be in
italics and multi-character identifiers should be in
upright type.  That is how the reader tells Hom from H times o times m
(even if s/he hasn't consciously learned the rule).

<p>
In order to make this
easy to implement, TAC provides a number of useful macros that authors are free to use.
The first group all have the same syntax and provide an easy way to
create macros that produce characters or strings in different fonts.
They are:<br>
<tt>
\mathrmdef<br>
\mathbfdef<br>
\mathssbxdef<br>
\mathfkdef<br>
\mathzcdef<br>
\mathcaldef<br>
\mathrsfsdef<br>
\mathopdef<br>
\mathopsldef<br>
</tt>
</p>
<p>

The syntax:  If you say
  <tt>\mathrmdef{Hom}</tt>
  you create a macro named <tt>\Hom</tt> that sets Hom in roman type with the
usual spacing of a word.  If, instead you say
  <tt>\mathrmdef[hom]{Hom}</tt>
  you get a macro named \hom that produces Hom, just as above.
If you use that instead of just Hom, the results will look much better.
Using just Hom in math mode will result in an italic font and ugly
spacing that is more appropriate to a ternary product.
</p>
<p>

The semantics: <tt>\mathrmdef</tt> is as described; <tt>\mathbfdef</tt> produces bold
characters; <tt>\mathssbxdef</tt> produces characters in an extra bold sans serif
font; <tt>\mathfkdef</tt> makes fraktur producing macros; <tt>\mathzcdef</tt> produces Zapf
Chancery, (a useful script font that includes both upper and lower case
letters so that <tt>\mathzcdef{Set}</tt> makes a macro \Set that gives Set in
that font); <tt>\mathrsfsdef</tt> defines a macro that uses Ralph Smith fancy
script; <tt>\mathcaldef</tt> gives the standard calligraphic forms; finally
<tt>\mathopdef</tt> makes \mathop{}s, explained below, using roman
character, while <tt>\mathopsldef</tt> does the same using slant characters
(almost, but not quite the same as italic).
</p>
<p>

Perhaps the only place <tt>\mathop</tt> is clearly explained is in the <i>TeXBook</i>
(The description in <i>The LaTeX Companion</i> is just wrong; <tt>\mathop</tt> is
used only to define large operators).  If you define a macro such as
<tt>\lim</tt> as a mathop, which you can by the TAC macro <tt>\mathopdef{lim}</tt> or in
standard plain (or LaTeX for that matter by
<tt>\def\lim{\mathop{\rm lim}}</tt>
you have defined a macro that sets "lim" in roman type, leaves a
<tt>\thinspace</tt> after it (unless followed by a "(" or other token of type
<tt>\mathopen</tt>) and, in display mode only, puts any subscript underneath
instead of to the right.  However, this last can be overruled.  If you
type <tt>\lim\limits_{whatever}</tt>, even online, the result is to put the
"whatever" underneath, while if you type <tt>\lim\nolimits_{whatever}</tt>, even
in a display, the effect is to subscript the "whatever" on the right.
(If you are interested, these names mean "limitswitch" and
"nolimitswitch".)
</p>
<p>

Two more comments: the macros defined using these defining macros can be
used in either math mode or not.  Also, they add space after themselves
unless followed by punctuation marks or certain other symbols (like
braces).  So if you define, say, <tt>\mathzcdef[Asc]{A}</tt>, you can say, "Let
\Asc be a category" and you will get no complaint that you were not in
math mode and there will be a space after the script "A".  If you have
defined <tt>\mathrmdef[nbd]{neighbourhood}</tt>, then you cannot say <tt>\nbd s</tt> to
get the plural since the space will be added, but either <tt>\nbd{s}</tt> or
<tt>\nbd{}s</tt> will work fine.

</p>

<h4>Multi-line displays</h4>


<p>
Another useful macro that we supply is <tt>\mld</tt>.  It is used in a display as
follows:<br>
<tt>
$$\mld formula1& formula2\\formula3\\formula4\\...$$
</tt><br>
and produces a multi-line display formatted as<br>
<pre><tt>
           formula1  formula2
                     formula3
                     formula4
                     ...
</tt></pre>
<p>
Only one <tt>&</tt> is to be used and it can occur anywhere except that if
formula1 is empty, you should use <tt>\mld{}&</tt>.  This is a bug that might be
fixed some day.
</p>




<a name="references"></a>
<h3>References and bibliography styles</h3>
<p>
When you want to refer to Theorem A (which will not be called that in
the <em>TAC</em> style) of Section 4.3, refer to it as Theorem~\ref{thmA} of
Section~\ref{mainth}.  The labels you use are totally arbitrary, of
course, so long as they are not reused in the same paper.
<em>
Use of
symbolic labels allows you to insert or delete material without having
to renumber everything
</em>
or to wind up with sections or theorems bis.  The
~, by the way, is an unbreakable space so that the theorem or section
number does not get separated from the word Theorem or Section.  This is
considered poor style, although it is not terribly important.  It is
also an element of good style to capitalize the words Section and
Theorem when followed by an explicit reference.  However, they are not
capitalized in such phrases as "next section" and "the main theorem".


<p>
If BiBTeX is used with LaTeX, <b>bibliographies must be BiBTeXed</b>
and any .bbl files included in the source file. No .bib files will be
accepted.
</p>
<p>
References may use the standard BiBTeX styles or
the two bibliography styles that <em>TAC</em> supports.
<em>
We recommend the first TAC style</em>. It is much more useful for
the reader since it puts citations like
[Grothendieck, 1957] in your text (you can probably already guess the
reference) and the reference in the form
<pre><code>
\item A. Grothendieck (1957), Sur quelques points d'alg\'ebre homologique, T\^ohoku
Math. J. \em{3}, 120-221.
</code></pre>
<p>
You get the first style by preceding your references with
</p>
<pre><code>
\begin{references}
</code></pre>
<p>
and ending the list of \items with
</p>
<pre><code>
\end{references}
</code></pre>
<p>
The second style is traditional and puts [4] into your
paper with the reference in the traditional form
</p>
<pre><code>
\item A. Grothendieck, Sur quelques points d'alg\'ebre homologique, T\^ohoku
Math. J. \em{3} (1957), 120-221.
</code></pre>
<p>
To obtain it use
</p>
<pre><code>
\begin{references*}

 \item ...

\end{references*}
</code></pre>
<p>
except you will almost surely want to use \bibitem, allowing you to put
in a symbolic label.
</p>
<p>
A useful package that also implements the recommended first style
above is natbib with the square-bracket option invoked with:</br></br>
<tt>  \usepackage[square]{natbib} </tt> </br></br>
and then replace every <tt>\cite</tt> by:</br>
<tt> \citep </tt> to produce  [Author, year] </br>
<tt> \citet </tt>  to produce  Author [year]  </br>
<tt> \citeyearpar </tt>  to produce  [year]  </br></br>
The package is found at </br></br>

<h3>Avoidable errors </h3>
<p>
There are two mistakes made by many users of TeX that appear in print
over and over and are easy to avoid.
</p>
<p>
The first is to have multicharacter identifiers
<em>slanted (like math symbols)</em>, rather than in upright type.
This refers to names like sin, cos,...
but also Hom, Tor, Id, ker, Im, ....  The <em>TAC</em> style files provide macros
that can automate this, as noted above.
</p>

<p>
The second error is to use &lt; ... &gt; for angle brackets.  You have no idea
how bad this will look.  The &lt; and &gt; produce the wrong shape for angle
brackets, but mainly they produce the wrong spacing and the results can
be ludicrous, especially if an = follows &gt; or precedes &lt;.  The official
way to do this is to say \langle and \rangle.  Many papers in
<em>TAC</em> use these angle brackets extensively and make little or no use of
the inequality signs.  If this is your case, we recommend the following.
At the top of your paper, put:
</p>
<pre><code>
\mathcode`\<="4268 %left delimiter
\mathcode`\>="5269 %right delimiter
\mathchardef\gt="313E %relation
\mathchardef\lt="313C %relation
</code></pre>
<p>
The effect of the first two lines is to make &lt; and &gt; into \langle and
\rangle, respectively, so that you can use them freely.  The third and
fourth lines allow you to use \lt and \gt for the inequality signs.
This is <b>not</b> done in the <em>TAC</em> styles because an author has the right to
use &lt; and &gt; for the inequalites if desired.

Although these instructions are specific to TAC, they should go a long
way towards making your papers usable by any journal that is serious
about using author-supplied TeX.

ARCHIVE POLICY
</a>
</h3>

<p>
1. The primary archive of Theory and Applications of
Categories(<em>TAC</em>) is a set of electronic files in TeX source, dvi,
pdf and pk font formats. The source files contain all articles accepted in
<em>TAC</em> and any macro files required to typeset them. The dvi files
are those produced from the articles by the TeX program (version 3.14).
Font files to allow printing of accepted articles must also be maintained.
This archive is the property of the Editorial Board of <em>TAC</em> and is
maintained by the Managing Editor.
</p>

<p>
2. A secondary electronic archive of <em>TAC</em> is maintained by
The National Library of Canada
at
<a href ="http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/201/300/tac/index.html">
http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/201/300/tac/index.html
</a>
as part of its
Electronic Collection.
</p>

<!--
<p>

3. A paper copy of the typeset version of each article accepted in
<em>TAC</em> is provided to the Mount Allison University Library
for archiving.

LaTeX MACROS FOR DIAGRAMS

The links here are to macro packages (and their documentation)
intended to facilitate creation of category theory diagrams in LaTeX.

The packages are:

<p>
Michael Barr's front-end for XY-pic. It uses syntax similar to
his now obsolete package based on the LaTeX
picture mode and, in the opinion of the <i>TAC</i> Managing Editor,
provides the most attractive output for typeset
categorical diagrams.

There are two advantages to diagxy over xymatrix. First, simple diagrams,
e.g. triangles, are predefined. Second, the user has precise control
over positioning and spacing. You do not have to choose between
ill-fitting nodes and extra long arrows.
