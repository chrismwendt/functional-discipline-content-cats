<h1>
An extended view of the Chu-construction
</h1><h2>

<p> 

The cyclic Chu-construction for closed bicategories with
  pullbacks, which generalizes the original Chu-construction for
  symmetric monoidal closed categories, turns out to have a non-cyclic
  counterpart.  Both use so-called Chu-spans as new 1-cells between
  1-cells of the underlying bicategory, which form the new objects.
  Chu-spans may be seen as a natural generalization of 2-cell-spans
  in the base bicategory that no longer are confined to a single
  hom-category.  This view helps to clarify the composition of
  Chu-spans.
<p>
  We consider various approaches of linking the underlying bicategory
  with the newly constructed ones, e.g. by means of two-dimensional
  generalizations of bifibrations.  In the quest for a better
  connection, we investigate, whether Chu-spans form a double
  category.  While this turns out not to be the case, we are led to
  considering a generalization of the construction to paths of 1-cells in
  the base, leading to two hierarchies of closed bicategories, one for
  linear paths and one for loops.  The possibility of moving beyond
  paths, respectively, loops of the same length is indicated.

<p>
 Finally, Chu-spans in <i>rel</i> are identified as bipartite state 
transition
  systems.  Even though their composition may fail here due to the
  lack of pullbacks in <i>rel</i>, basic game-theoretic constructions can
  be performed on cyclic Chu-spans.  These are available in all
  symmetric monoidal closed categories with finite products.  If
  pullbacks exist as well, the bicategory of cyclic Chu-spans inherits
  a monoidal structure that on objects coincides with the categorical
  product.
