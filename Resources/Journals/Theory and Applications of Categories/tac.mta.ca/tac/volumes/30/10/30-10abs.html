Lax formal theory of monads, monoidal approach to bicategorical

Generalized operads, also called generalized multicategories and
$T$-monoids, are defined as monads within a Kleisli bicategory. With or
without emphasizing their monoidal nature, generalized operads have
been considered by numerous authors in different contexts, with
examples including symmetric multicategories, topological spaces,
globular operads and Lawvere theories. In this paper we study
functoriality of the Kleisli construction, and correspondingly that of
generalized operads.  Motivated by this problem we develop a lax
version of the formal theory of monads, and study its connection to
bicategorical structures.
