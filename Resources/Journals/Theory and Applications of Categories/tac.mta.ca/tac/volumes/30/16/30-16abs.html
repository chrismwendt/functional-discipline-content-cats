Polynomials in categories with pullbacks

<p> 

The theory developed by Gambino and Kock, of polynomials over a locally
cartesian closed category E, is generalised for E just having pullbacks.  The
2-categorical analogue of the theory of polynomials and polynomial functors is
given, and its relationship with Street's theory of fibrations within
2-categories is explored. Johnstone's notion of "bagdomain data" is adapted to
the present framework to make it easier to completely exhibit examples of
polynomial monads.
