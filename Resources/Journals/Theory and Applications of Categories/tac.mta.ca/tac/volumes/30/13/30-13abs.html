Operadic definitions of weak n-category: coherence and comparisons

This paper concerns the relationships between notions of weak n-category
defined as algebras for n-globular operads, as well as their coherence
properties.  We focus primarily on the definitions due to Batanin and Leinster.

</p>
<p>

    A correspondence between the contractions and systems of compositions
used in Batanin's definition, and the unbiased contractions used in
Leinster's definition, has long been suspected, and we prove a conjecture
of Leinster that shows that the two notions are in some sense equivalent.
We then prove several coherence theorems which apply to algebras for any
operad with a contraction and system of compositions or with an unbiased
contraction; these coherence theorems thus apply to weak $n$-categories in
the senses of Batanin, Leinster, Penon and Trimble.

</p>
<p>


We then take some steps towards a comparison between Batanin weak
n-categories and Leinster weak n-categories.  We describe a canonical
adjunction between the categories of these, giving a construction of the left
adjoint, which is applicable in more generality to a class of functors induced
by monad morphisms.  We conclude with some preliminary statements about a
possible weak equivalence of some sort between these categories.
