Transformation double categories associated to 2-group actions

Transformation groupoids associated to group actions capture the interplay
between global and local symmetries of structures described in
set-theoretic terms. This paper examines the analogous situation for
structures described in category-theoretic terms, where symmetry is
expressed as the action of a 2-group G (equivalently, a categorical
group) on a category C. It describes the construction of a
transformation groupoid in diagrammatic terms, and considers this
construction internal to Cat, the category of categories. The
result is a double category C//G which describes the local
symmetries of C. We define this and describe some of its structure,
with the adjoint action of G on itself as a guiding example.
