<h1> 
Gauge invariant surface holonomy and monopoles

<p> 

There are few known computable examples of non-abelian surface
holonomy. In this paper, we give
several examples whose structure 2-groups are covering 2-groups
and show that the surface
holonomies can be computed via a simple formula in terms of paths
of 1-dimensional holonomies
inspired by earlier work of Chan Hong-Mo and Tsou Sheung Tsun on
magnetic monopoles.
As a consequence of our work and that of Schreiber and
Waldorf, this formula
gives a rigorous meaning to non-abelian magnetic flux for magnetic
monopoles. In the process, we
discuss gauge covariance of surface holonomies for spheres for any
2-group, therefore generalizing
the notion of the reduced group introduced by Schreiber and
Waldorf. Using these
ideas, we also prove that magnetic monopoles form an abelian
group.
