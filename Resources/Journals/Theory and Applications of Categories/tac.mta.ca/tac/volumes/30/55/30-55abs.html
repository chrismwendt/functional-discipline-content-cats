<h1> 
Groupoids in categories with pretopology
</h1>
<h2> 
Ralf Meyer and Chenchang Zhu

<p> 

We survey the general theory of groupoids, groupoid actions,
  groupoid principal bundles, and various kinds of morphisms between
  groupoids in the framework of categories with
  pretopology. The categories of topological spaces and finite or
  infinite dimensional manifolds are examples of such categories.  We
  study extra assumptions on pretopologies that are needed for this
  theory.  We check these extra assumptions in several categories with
  pretopologies.

</p>
<p>
  Functors between groupoids may be localised at equivalences in two
  ways.  One uses spans of functors, the other bibundles (commuting
  actions) of groupoids.  We show that both approaches give equivalent
  bicategories.  Another type of groupoid morphism, called an actor,
  is closely related to functors between the categories of groupoid
  actions.  We also generalise actors using bibundles, and show that
  this gives another bicategory of groupoids.
