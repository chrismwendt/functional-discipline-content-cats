Finite categories with pushouts

Let C be a finite category.  For an object X of C one has the hom-functor
Hom(-,X) of C to Set. If G is a subgroup of Aut(X), one has the
quotient functor Hom(-,X)/G. We show that any finite product of hom-functors
of C is a sum of hom-functors if and only if C has pushouts and
coequalizers and that any finite product of hom-functors of C is a sum of
functors of the form \Hom(-,X)/G if and only if C has pushouts. These are
variations of the fact that a finite category has products if and only if it
has coproducts.
