We generalize the concept of a strong inclusion on a biframe to that of a
proximity on a biframe, which is related to the concept of a strong
bi-inclusion on a frame introduced by Picado and Pultr. We also generalize
the concept of a bi-compactification of a biframe to that of a
compactification of a biframe, and prove that the poset of
compactifications of a biframe L is isomorphic to the poset of proximities
on L. As a corollary, we obtain Schauerte's characterization of
bi-compactifications of a biframe. In the spatial case this yields Blatter
and Seever's characterization of compactifications of completely regular
ordered spaces and a characterization of bi-compactifications of
completely regular bispaces.
