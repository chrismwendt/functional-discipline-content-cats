Internal algebra classifiers as codescent objects of crossed internal

Inspired by recent work of Batanin and Berger on the homotopy theory of
operads, a general monad-theoretic context for speaking about
structures within structures is presented, and the problem of
constructing the universal ambient structure containing the prescribed
internal structure is studied. Following the work of Lack, these
universal objects must be constructed from simplicial objects arising
from our monad-theoretic framework, as certain 2-categorical colimits
called codescent objects. We isolate the extra structure present on
these simplicial objects which enable their codescent objects to be
computed. These are the crossed internal categories of the title, and
generalise the crossed simplicial groups of Loday and Fiedorowicz. The
most general results of this article are concerned with how to compute
such codescent objects in 2-categories of internal categories, and on
isolating conditions on the monad-theoretic situation which enable
these results to apply. Combined with earlier work of the author in
which operads are seen as polynomial 2-monads, our results are then
applied to the theory of non-symmetric, symmetric and braided operads.
In particular, the well-known construction of a PROP from an operad is
recovered, as an illustration of our techniques.
