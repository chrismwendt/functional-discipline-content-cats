<h1> 
Cyclic homology arising from adjunctions

<p> 

Given a monad and a comonad, one obtains a distributive law between them from
lifts of one through an adjunction for the other. In particular, this yields
for any bialgebroid the Yetter-Drinfel'd distributive law between the comonad
given by a module coalgebra and the monad given by a comodule algebra. It is
this self-dual setting that reproduces the cyclic homology of associative and
of Hopf algebras in the monadic framework of B&ouml;hm and Stefan.  In fact,
their approach generates two duplicial objects and morphisms between them which
are mutual inverses if and only if the duplicial objects are cyclic. A
2-categorical perspective on the process of twisting coefficients is provided
and the role of the two notions of bimonad studied in the literature is
clarified.
