Operads as polynomial 2-monads

In this article we give a construction of a polynomial 2-monad from an
operad and describe the algebras of the 2-monads which then arise. This
construction is different from the standard construction of a monad
from an operad in that the algebras of our associated 2-monad are the
categorified algebras of the original operad. Moreover it enables us to
characterise operads as categorical polynomial monads in a canonical
way. This point of view reveals categorical polynomial monads as a
unifying environment for operads, Cat-operads and clubs. We recover the
standard construction of a monad from an operad in a 2-categorical way
from our associated 2-monad as a coidentifier of 2-monads, and
understand the algebras of both as weak morphisms of operads into a
Cat-operad of categories. Algebras of operads within general symmetric
monoidal categories arise from our new associated 2-monad in a
canonical way. When the operad is sigma-free, we establish a Quillen
equivalence, with respect to the model structures on algebras of
2-monads found by Lack, between the strict algebras of our associated
2-monad, and those of the standard one.
