We introduce a 3-dimensional categorical structure which we call
intercategory. This is a kind of weak triple category with three
kinds of arrows, three kinds of 2-dimensional cells and one kind
of 3-dimensional cells. In one dimension, the compositions are
strictly associative and unitary, whereas in the other two, these
laws only hold up to coherent isomorphism. The main feature is that
the interchange law between the second and third compositions does
not hold, but rather there is a non-invertible comparison cell
which satisfies some coherence conditions. We introduce appropriate
morphisms of intercategory, of which there are three types, and
cells relating these. We show that these fit together to produce a
strict triple category of intercategories.
