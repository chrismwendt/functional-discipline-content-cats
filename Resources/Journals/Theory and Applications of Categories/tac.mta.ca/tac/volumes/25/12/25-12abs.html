Towards a homotopy theory of higher dimensional transition systems

<p>

We proved in a previous work that Cattani-Sassone's higher
  dimensional transition systems can be interpreted as a
  small-orthogonality class of a topological locally finitely
  presentable category of weak higher dimensional transition
  systems. In this paper, we turn our attention to the full
  subcategory of weak higher dimensional transition systems which are
  unions of cubes. It is proved that there exists a left proper
  combinatorial model structure such that two objects are weakly
  equivalent if and only if they have the same cubes after
  simplification of the labelling. This model structure is obtained by
  Bousfield localizing a model structure which is left determined with
  respect to a class of maps which is not the class of monomorphisms.
  We prove that the higher dimensional transition systems
  corresponding to two process algebras are weakly equivalent if and
  only if they are isomorphic. We also construct a second Bousfield
  localization in which two bisimilar cubical transition systems are
  weakly equivalent.  The appendix contains a technical lemma about
  smallness of weak factorization systems in coreflective
  subcategories which can be of independent interest.  This paper is a
first step towards a homotopical interpretation of bisimulation for
  higher dimensional transition systems.
