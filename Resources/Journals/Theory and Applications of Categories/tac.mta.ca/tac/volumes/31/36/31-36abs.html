Products of families of types and $(\Pi,\lambda)$-structures on C-systems

<p> 

In this paper we continue, following the pioneering works by J. Cartmell
and T. Streicher, the study of the most important structures on
C-systems, the structures that correspond, in the case of the syntactic
C-systems, to the $(\Pi,\lambda,app,\beta,\eta)$-system of inference
rules.
</p><p>
One such structure was introduced by J. Cartmell and later studied by T.
Streicher under the name of the products of families of types.
</p><p>

We introduce the notion of a $(\Pi,\lambda)$-structure and construct a
bijection, for a given C-system, between the set of
$(\Pi,\lambda)$-structures and the set of Cartmell-Streicher structures.
In the following paper we will show how to construct, and in some cases
fully classify, the $(\Pi,\lambda)$-structures on the C-systems that
correspond to universe categories.
</p><p>

The first section of the paper provides careful proofs of many of the
properties of general C-systems.

Methods of the paper are fully constructive, that is, neither the axiom of
excluded middle nor the axiom of choice are used.
