Some insights on bicategories of fractions: representations and
compositions of 2-morphisms

In this paper we investigate the construction of bicategories of fractions
originally described by D.~Pronk: given any bicategory $C$ together
with a suitable class of morphisms $W$, one can construct a bicategory
$C[W^{-1}]$, where all the morphisms of $W$ are turned into
internal equivalences, and that is universal with respect to this
property. Most of the descriptions leading to this construction were long
and heavily based on the axiom of choice. In this paper we considerably
simplify the description of the equivalence relation on 2-morphisms and
the constructions of associators, vertical and horizontal compositions in
$C[W^{-1}]$, thus proving that the axiom of choice is not needed
under certain conditions. The simplified description of associators and
compositions will also play a crucial role in two forthcoming papers about
pseudofunctors and equivalences between bicategories of fractions.
