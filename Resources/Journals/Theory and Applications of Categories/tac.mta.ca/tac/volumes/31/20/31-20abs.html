We define a notion of morphism for quotient vector bundles that yields
both a category $QVBun$ and a contravariant global sections functor
$C:QVBun^{op} \to Vect$ whose restriction to trivial vector bundles with
fiber F coincides with the contravariant functor $Top^{op} \to Vect$ of
F-valued continuous functions. Based on this we obtain a linear extension
of the adjunction between the categories of topological spaces and
locales: (i) a linearized topological space is a <i>spectral vector
bundle</i>, by which is meant a mildly restricted type of quotient vector
bundle; (ii) a <i>linearized locale</i> is a locale $\Delta$ equipped with
both a topological vector space A and a $\Delta$-valued <i>support map</i>
for the elements of A satisfying a continuity condition relative to the
spectrum of $\Delta$ and the lower Vietoris topology on $Sub A$;  (iii) we
obtain an adjunction between the full subcategory of spectral vector
bundles $QVBun_\Sigma$ and the category of linearized locales $LinLoc$,
which restricts to an equivalence of categories between sober spectral
vector bundles and spatial linearized locales. The spectral vector bundles
are classified by a finer topology on $Sub A$, called the open support
topology, but there is no notion of universal spectral vector bundle for
an arbitrary topological vector space A.
