The linearity of traces in monoidal categories and bicategories

<p> 

We show that in any symmetric monoidal category, if a weight for
  colimits is absolute, then the resulting colimit of any diagram of
  dualizable objects is again dualizable.  Moreover, in this case, if
  an endomorphism of the colimit is induced by an endomorphism of the
  diagram, then its trace can be calculated as a linear combination of
  traces on the objects in the diagram.  The formal nature of this
  result makes it easy to generalize to traces in homotopical contexts
  (using derivators) and traces in bicategories.  These
  generalizations include the familiar additivity of the Euler
  characteristic and Lefschetz number along cofiber sequences, as well
  as an analogous result for the Reidemeister trace, but also the
  orbit-counting theorem for sets with a group action, and a general
  formula for homotopy colimits over EI-categories.
