<p> 

Unlike the uniform completion, the Dedekind completion of a vector lattice
is not functorial. In order to repair the lack of functoriality of
Dedekind completions, we enrich the signature of vector lattices with a
proximity relation, thus arriving at the category <b>pdv</b> of proximity
Dedekind vector lattices. We prove that the Dedekind completion induces a
functor from the category <b>bav</b> of bounded archimedean vector
lattices to <b>pdv</b>, which in fact is an equivalence. We utilize the
results of Dilworth to show that every proximity Dedekind vector lattice D
is represented as the normal real-valued functions on the compact
Hausdorff space associated with D. This yields a contravariant adjunction
between <b>pdv</b> and the category <b>KHaus</b> of compact Hausdorff
spaces, which restricts to a dual equivalence between <b>KHaus</b> and the
proper subcategory of <b>pdv</b> consisting of those proximity Dedekind
vector lattices in which the proximity is uniformly closed. We show how to
derive the classic Yosida Representation, Kakutani-Krein Duality,
Stone-Gelfand-Naimark Duality, and Stone-Nakano Theorem from our approach.
