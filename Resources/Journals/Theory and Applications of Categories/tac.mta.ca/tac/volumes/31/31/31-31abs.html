<h1> 
Tannaka theory over sup-lattices and descent for topoi
</h1>
<h2> 
Eduardo J. Dubuc and Martin Szyld

<p> 

We consider locales B as algebras in the tensor category <i>sl</i> of
sup-lattices. We show the equivalence between the Joyal-Tierney
descent theorem for open localic surjections
q : shB  --> E 
in Galois theory and a Tannakian recognition theorem over
<i>sl</i> for the <i>sl</i>-functor
Rel (q^*) : Rel(E) -->  Rel(shB) \cong (B-Mod)_0 
into the <i>sl</i>-category of
discrete B-modules.
Thus, a new Tannaka recognition theorem is obtained, essentially
different from those known so far.
This equivalence follows from two independent results. We develop an
explicit construction of  the localic groupoid G 
 associated by Joyal-Tierney to q,
and do an exhaustive comparison with the Deligne Tannakian
construction of the Hopf algebroid L
associated to Rel(q^*),
and show they are isomorphic, that is, L \cong O(G).  On
the other hand, we show that the <i>sl</i>-category of relations of the
classifying topos of any localic groupoid G, is equivalent to the
<i>sl</i>-category of L-comodules with discrete subjacent B-module,
where L = O(G).}

We are forced to work over an arbitrary base topos because, contrary
to the neutral case which can be developed completely over Sets, here
change of base techniques are unavoidable.
