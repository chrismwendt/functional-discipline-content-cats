Quotient categories and phases

<p> 

We study properties of a category after quotienting out a suitable chosen
group of isomorphisms on each object. Coproducts in the original category
are described in its quotient by our new weaker notion of a `phased
coproduct'. We examine these and show that any suitable category with them
arises as such a quotient of a category with coproducts. Motivation comes
from projective geometry, and also quantum theory where they describe
superpositions in the category of Hilbert spaces and continuous linear
maps up to global phase. The quotients we consider also generalise those
induced by categorical isotropy in the sense of Funk et al.
