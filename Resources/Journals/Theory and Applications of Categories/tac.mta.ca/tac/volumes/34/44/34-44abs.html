The dual of compact ordered spaces is a variety

<p> 

In a recent paper (2018), D. Hofmann, R. Neves and P.  Nora proved that
the dual of the category of compact ordered spaces and monotone continuous
maps is a quasi-variety -not finitary, but bounded by $\aleph_1$. An open
question was: is it also a variety? We show that the answer is
affirmative. We describe the variety by means of a set of finitary
operations, together with an operation of countably infinite arity, and
equational axioms. The dual equivalence is induced by the dualizing object
[0,1].
