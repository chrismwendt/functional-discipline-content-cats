On spans with right fibred right adjoints

We introduce a new condition on an abstract span of categories which
we refer to as having right fibred right adjoints, RFRA  for short.
We show that:
</p><p>

(a) the <i>span of split extensions</i> of a semi-abelian category
C has RFRA if and only if C is action representable;

<br>
(b) the <i>reversed span</i> to the one considered in (a) has
RFRA if and only if C is locally algebraically cartesian closed;

<br>
(c) the span of split extensions of the category of morphisms of C
has RFRA if and only if C is action representable and has
normalizers;

<br>
(d) the reversed span to the one considered in (c) has
RFRA if and only if C is locally algebraically cartesian closed.
</p><p>
We also examine our condition for the span of monoid actions (of
monoids in a monoidal category C on objects in a given category on
which C acts), and for various other spans.
