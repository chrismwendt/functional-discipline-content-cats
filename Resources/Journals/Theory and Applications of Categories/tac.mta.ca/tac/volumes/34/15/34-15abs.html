We continue the program of <i>structural differential geometry</i> that
begins with the notion of a tangent category, an axiomatization of
structural aspects of the tangent functor on the category of smooth
manifolds.  In classical geometry, having an affine structure on a
manifold is equivalent to having a flat torsion-free connection on its
tangent bundle. This equivalence allows us to define a category of affine
objects associated to a tangent category and we show that the resulting
category is also a tangent category, as are several related categories.  
As a consequence of some of these ideas we also give two new
characterizations of flat torsion-free connections.

We also consider 2-categorical structure associated to the category of
tangent categories and demonstrate that assignment of the tangent
category of affine objects to a tangent category induces a 2-comonad.
