Colimits  of monoids

If C is a monoidal category with reflexive coequalizers which are
preserved by tensoring from both sides, then the category MonC of monoids
over C has all coequalizers and these are regular epimorphisms in C. This
implies that MonC has all colimits which exist in C, provided that C in
addition has (regular epi, jointly monomorphic)-factorizations of
discrete cones and admits arbitrary free monoids. A further application
is a lifting theorem for adjunctions with a monoidal right adjoint whose
left adjoint is not necessarily strong to adjunctions between the
respective categories of monoids.
