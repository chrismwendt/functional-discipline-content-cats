This paper studies a category X with an endofunctor T : X \to X.
A T-algebra is given by a morphism Tx \to x in X.  We examine the
related questions of when T freely generates a triple (or monad) on
X; when an object x in X freely generates a T-algebra; and when
the category of T-algebras has coequalizers and other colimits.  The
paper defines a category of ``T-horns'' which effectively contains X
as well as all T-algebras.  It is assume that  Xs  is cocomplete and
has a factorization system (E,M) satisfying reasonable properties.
An ordinal-indexed sequence of T-horns is then defined which provides
successive approximations to a free T-algebra generated by an object
x in X, as well as approximations to coequalizers and other colimits
for the category of T-algebras.  Using the notions of an M-cone and a
separated T-horn it is shown that if X is M-well-powered, then the
ordinal sequence stabilizes at the desired free algebra or coequalizer or
other colimit whenever they exist.  This paper is a successor to a
paper written by the first author in 1970 that showed that T generates
a free triple when every x in X generates a free T-algebra.  We
also consider colimits in triple algebras and give some examples of
functors T for which no x in X generates a free
T-algebra.
