<h1> 
Fibred pseudo double categories for game semantics

Clovis Eberhart, Tom Hirschowitz

<p> 

We unify previous constructions from our work on concurrent game
  semantics into a single categorical framework. From an operational
  description of positions and moves in some game, called a
  \emph{signature}, we produce a pseudo double category, in which
  objects are positions and vertical morphisms are plays. The
  considered games are multi-player, so it makes sense to consider
  embeddings of positions: these are the horizontal
  morphisms. Finally, cells may be thought of as embeddings of plays
  preserving initial and final positions. In order to be suitable for
  game semantics, the obtained pseudo double category should enjoy a
  certain fibredness property. Under suitable hypotheses, we show that
  our construction actually produces such a \emph{fibred} pseudo
  double category, from which we can define relevant categories of
  plays, and thus of strategies. We give a first necessary and
  sufficient criterion for this to hold and then a sufficient
  criterion that can be checked more easily.
