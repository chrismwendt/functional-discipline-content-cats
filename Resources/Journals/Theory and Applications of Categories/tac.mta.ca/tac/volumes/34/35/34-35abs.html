<p> 

A simple criterion for a functor to be finitary is presented: we call
F finitely bounded if for all objects X every finitely generated
subobject of FX factorizes through the F-image of a finitely generated
subobject of X. This is equivalent to F being finitary for all
functors between `reasonable' locally finitely presentable categories,
provided that F preserves monomorphisms. We also discuss the question
when that last assumption can be dropped.  The answer is affirmative for
functors between categories such as Set, K-Vec (vector spaces), boolean
algebras, and actions of any finite group either on Set or on K-Vec for
fields K of characteristic 0.

All this generalizes to locally $\lambda$-presentable categories,
$\lambda$-accessible functors and $\lambda$-presentable algebras. As an
application we obtain an easy proof that the Hausdorff functor on the
category of complete metric spaces is $\aleph_1$-accessible.
