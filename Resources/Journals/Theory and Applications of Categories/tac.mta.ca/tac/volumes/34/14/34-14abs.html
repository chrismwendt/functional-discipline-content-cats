Well-closed subschemes of noncommutative schemes

Van den Bergh has defined the blowup of a noncommutative surface at a
point lying on a commutative divisor. We study one aspect of the
construction, with an eventual aim of defining more general kinds of
noncommutative blowups. Our basic object of study is a quasi-scheme X (a
Grothendieck category). Given a closed subcategory Z, in order to define
a blowup of X along Z one first needs to have a functor F_Z which is an
analog of tensoring with the defining ideal of Z.  Following Van den
Bergh, a closed subcategory Z which has such a functor is called
well-closed.  We show that well-closedness can be characterized by the
existence of certain projective effacements for each object of X, and
that the needed functor F_Z has an explicit description in terms of such
effacements.  As an application, we prove that closed points are
well-closed in quite general quasi-schemes.
