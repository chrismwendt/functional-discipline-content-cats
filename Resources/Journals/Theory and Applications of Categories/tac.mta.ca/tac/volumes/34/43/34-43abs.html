Products and coequalizers in pointed categories

In this paper, we investigate the property (P) that binary products
commute with arbitrary coequalizers in pointed categories. Examples of
such categories include any regular unital or (pointed) majority category
with coequalizers, as well as any pointed factor permutable category with
coequalizers. We establish a Mal'tsev term condition characterizing
pointed varieties of universal algebras satisfying (P). We then consider
categories satisfying (P) locally, i.e., those categories for which every
fibre of the fibration of points satisfies (P). Examples include any
regular Mal'tsev or majority category with coequalizers, as well as any
regular Gumm category with coequalizers. Varieties satisfying (P) locally
are also characterized by a Mal'tsev term condition, which turns out to be
equivalent to a variant of Gumm's shifting lemma. Furthermore, we show
that the varieties satisfying (P) locally are precisely the varieties with
normal local projections in the sense of Z. Janelidze.
