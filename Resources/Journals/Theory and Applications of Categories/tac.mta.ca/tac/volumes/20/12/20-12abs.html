<h1>
Colimits of representable algebra-valued functors
</h1><h2>
George M. Bergman

<p> 

If C and D are varieties of algebras in the sense
of general algebra, then by a representable functor
C --> D we understand a functor which, when
composed with the forgetful functor D --> Set, gives a
representable functor in the classical sense; Freyd showed that these
functors are determined by D-coalgebra objects of C.
Let Rep(C, D) denote the category of all
such functors, a full subcategory of Cat(C, D,
opposite to the category of D-coalgebras in C.
</p>
<p>
It is proved that Rep(C, D) has small
colimits, and in certain situations, explicit constructions for
the representing coalgebras are obtained.
</p><p>
In particular, Rep(C, D) always has an initial object.
This is shown to be ``trivial'' unless
C and D either both have <i>no</i> zeroary operations, or both
have <i>more than one</i> derived zeroary operation.
In those two cases, the functors in question may have
surprisingly opulent structures.

It is also shown that every set-valued representable functor
on C admits a universal morphism to a D-valued
representable functor.

Several examples are worked out in detail, and areas for further
investigation are noted.
