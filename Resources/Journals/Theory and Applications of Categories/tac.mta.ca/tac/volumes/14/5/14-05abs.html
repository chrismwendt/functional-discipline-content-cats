<h1>
Adjunction models for call-by-push-value with stacks
</h1><h2>
Paul Blain Levy
</h2>

<p> 
Call-by-push-value is a "semantic machine code", providing a set of simple
primitives from which both the call-by-value and call-by-name paradigms are
built. We present its operational semantics as a stack machine, suggesting a
term judgement of stacks. We then see that CBPV, incorporating these stack
terms, has a simple categorical semantics based on an adjunction between
values and stacks.  There are no coherence requirements.

</p> <p> 
We describe this semantics incrementally. First, we introduce locally indexed
categories and the opGrothendieck construction, and use these to give the
basic structure for interpreting the three judgements: values, stacks and
computations. Then we look at the universal property required to interpret
each type constructor. We define a model to be a strong adjunction with
countable coproducts, countable products and exponentials.

</p> <p> 
We see a wide range of instances of this structure: we give examples for
divergence, storage, erratic choice, continuations, possible worlds and games
(with or without a bracketing condition), in each case resolving the strong
monad from the literature into a strong adjunction.  And we give ways of
constructing models from other models. 

</p> <p> 
Finally, we see that call-by-value and call-by-name are interpreted within
the Kleisli and co-Kleisli parts, respectively, of a call-by-push-value
adjunction.
