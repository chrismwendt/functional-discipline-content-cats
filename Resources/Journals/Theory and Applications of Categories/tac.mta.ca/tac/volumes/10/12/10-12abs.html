Sober spaces and continuations 
</h1><h2>
Paul Taylor 
</h2>

<p> 
A topological space is sober if
    it has exactly the points that are dictated by its open sets.
    We explain the analogy with the way in which computational values
    are determined by the observations that can be made of them.
    A new definition of sobriety is formulated in terms of
    lambda calculus and elementary category theory,
    with no reference to lattice structure,
    but, for topological spaces, this coincides with the
    standard lattice-theoretic definition.
    The primitive symbolic and categorical structures are extended
    to make their types sober.
    For the natural numbers, the additional structure provides
    definition by description and general recursion. 
</p>
<p>
    We use the same basic categorical construction
    that Thielecke, Fuhrmann and Selinger use to study continuations,
    but our emphasis is completely different:
    we concentrate on the fragment of their calculus
    that <i>excludes</i> computational effects,
    but show how it nevertheless defines new <i>denotational</i> values.
    Nor is this ``denotational semantics of continuations
    using sober spaces'', though that could easily be derived.
</p>
<p>
    On the contrary, this paper provides the underlying $\lambda$-calculus
    on the basis of which abstract Stone duality will
    re-axiomatise general topology.
    The leading model of the new axioms is the category of locally compact
    locales and continuous maps.
