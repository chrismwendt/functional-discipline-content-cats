<h1>
Subspaces in abstract Stone duality 
</h1><h2>
Paul Taylor 
</h2>

<p> 
By <i>abstract</i> Stone duality we mean that the
   topology or contravariant powerset functor, seen as a self-adjoint
   exponential $\Sigma^{(-)}$ on some category,
   is monadic.
   Using Beck's theorem, this means that certain equalisers exist  
   and carry the subspace topology.
   These subspaces are encoded by idempotents that play
   a role similar to that of nuclei in locale theory.
</p>
<p>
   Par&eacute; showed that any elementary topos has this duality,
   and we prove it intuitionistically for
  the category of locally compact locales.
</p>
<p>
   The paper is largely concerned with the construction of such a category
   out of one that merely has powers of some fixed object $\Sigma$.
   It builds on <i>Sober Spaces and Continuations</i>,
   where the related but weaker notion of abstract sobriety was considered.
   The construction is done first by formally adjoining certain equalisers
   that $\Sigma^{(-)}$ takes to coequalisers,   
   then using Eilenberg-Moore algebras,
   and finally presented as a lambda calculus similar to
   the axiom of comprehension in set theory.
</p>
<p>
   The comprehension calculus has a normalisation theorem,
   by which every type can be embedded as a subspace of a type formed
   without comprehension, and terms also normalise in a simple way.
   The symbolic and categorical structures are thereby shown to be
   equivalent.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, sums and certain quotients are constructed
   using the comprehension calculus, giving an extensive category.
