<h1>
Functorial and algebraic properties of Browns P functor
</h1><h2>
Luis-Javier Hernandez-Paricio
</h2>

<p>
In 1975 E. M. Brown constructed a functor $\cal P$ which carries 
the tower of fundamental groups of the end of a (nice) space to 
the Brown-Grossman fundamental group. In this work, we study this 
functor and its extensions and analogues defined for pro-sets, 
pro-pointed sets, pro-groups and pro-abelian groups. The new
versions of the $\cal P$ functor are provided with more algebraic 
structure. Examples given in the paper prove that in general the 
$\cal P$ functors  are not faithful, however, one of our main 
results establishes that the restrictions of the corresponding 
$\cal P$ functors to the full subcategories of towers are faithful. 
We also prove that the restrictions of the $\cal P$ functors to 
the corresponding full subcategories of finitely generated towers 
are also full. Consequently, in these cases, the towers of objects 
in the categories of sets, pointed sets, groups and abelian groups, 
can be replaced by adequate algebraic models ($M$-sets, $M$-pointed 
sets, near-modules and modules.) The article also contains the 
construction of left adjoints for the $\cal P$ functors.
