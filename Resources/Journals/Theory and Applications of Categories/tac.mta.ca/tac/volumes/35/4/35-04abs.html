The 2-Chu-Dialectica construction and the polycategory of multivariable 
adjunctions
</h1>

<p>

Cheng, Gurski, and Riehl constructed a cyclic double multicategory
  of multivariable adjunctions.  We show that the same information is
  carried by a poly double category, in which opposite categories are
  polycategorical duals.  Moreover, this poly double category is a
  full substructure of a double Chu construction, whose objects are a
  sort of polarized category, and which is a natural home for
  2-categorical dualities.
</p><p>
  We obtain the double Chu construction using a general
  "Chu-Dialectica" construction on polycategories, which includes
  both the Chu construction and the categorical Dialectica
  construction of de Paiva.  The Chu and Dialectica constructions each
  impose additional hypotheses making the resulting polycategory
  representable (hence *-autonomous), but for different reasons;
  this leads to their apparent differences.
