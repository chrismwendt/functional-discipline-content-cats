 In contrast to the   fact that every completely distributive lattice is necessarily continuous in the sense of  Scott, it is shown that complete distributivity of a category enriched over the closed category obtained by endowing the  unit interval with a continuous t-norm does not imply its continuity in general. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the implication   are presented.
