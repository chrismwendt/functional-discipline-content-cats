<h1> 
The word problem for double categories

<p> 

We solve the word problem for free double categories without
equations between generators by translating it to the word problem
for 2-categories. This yields a quadratic algorithm deciding the
equality of diagrams in a free double category. The translation is
of interest in its own right since and can for instance be used to
reason about double categories with the language of 2-categories,
sidestepping the pinwheel problem. It also shows that although
double categories are formally more general than 2-categories, they are
not actually more expressive, explaining the rarity of applications of 
this notion.
