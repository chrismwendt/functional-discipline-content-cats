We construct combinatorial model category structures on the categories of   (marked) categories and  (marked) preadditive categories, and we characterize  (marked) additive categories as fibrant objects in a Bousfield localization of preadditive categories. These model category structures  are used to present the corresponding  infinity-categories obtained by inverting equivalences. We apply these results to explicitly  calculate   limits and colimits in these infinity-categories. The motivating application is a systematic construction of the equivariant coarse algebraic K-homology with coefficients in an additive category from its non-equivariant version.
