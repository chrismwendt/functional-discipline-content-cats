Bicategorical fibration structures and stacks

<p> 

In this paper we introduce two notions - systems of fibrant objects and
  fibration structures--- which will allow us to associate to a bicategory 
$B$ a
  homotopy bicategory $Ho(B)$ in such a way that $Ho(B)$
  is the universal way to add pseudo-inverses to weak equivalences in 
$B$.
  Furthermore, $Ho(B)$ is locally small when $B$ is and 
$Ho(B)$
  is a 2-category when $B$ is.  We thereby resolve two of the
  problems with known approaches to bicategorical localization.
<p>
  As an important example, we describe a fibration structure on
  the 2-category of prestacks on a site and prove that the resulting
  homotopy bicategory is the 2-category of stacks. We also show how this 
example
  can be restricted to obtain algebraic, differentiable and topological
(respectively)
  stacks as homotopy categories of algebraic, differential and topological
(respectively) prestacks.
