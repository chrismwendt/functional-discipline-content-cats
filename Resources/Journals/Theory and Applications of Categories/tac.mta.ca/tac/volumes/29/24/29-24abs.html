<h1> 
Stacks and sheaves of categories as fibrant objects, I

<p> 

We show that the category of categories fibred over a site is a
generalized Quillen model category in which the weak equivalences are the
local equivalences and the fibrant objects are the stacks, as they were
defined by J. Giraud. The generalized model category restricts to one on
the full subcategory whose objects are the categories fibred in groupoids.
We show that the category of sheaves of categories is a model category
that is Quillen equivalent to the generalized model category for stacks
and to the model category for strong stacks due to A. Joyal and M.
Tierney.
