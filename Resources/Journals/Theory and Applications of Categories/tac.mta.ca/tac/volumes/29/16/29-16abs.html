A Bayesian characterization of relative entropy

<p> 

We give a new characterization of relative entropy, also known as the
Kullback--Leibler divergence. We use a number of interesting categories
related to probability theory.  In particular, we consider a category
FinStat where an object is a finite set equipped with a probability
distribution, while a morphism is a measure-preserving function $f \maps X
\to Y$ together with a stochastic right inverse $s \maps Y \to X$.  The
function $f$ can be thought of as a measurement process, while $s$
provides a hypothesis about the state of the measured system given the
result of a measurement.  Given this data we can define the entropy of the
probability distribution on $X$ relative to the `prior' given by pushing
the probability distribution on $Y$ forwards along $s$.  We say that $s$
is `optimal' if these distributions agree.  We show that any convex
linear, lower semicontinuous functor from FinStat to the additive
monoid $[0,\infty]$ which vanishes when $s$ is optimal must be a scalar
multiple of this relative entropy.  Our proof is independent of all
earlier characterizations, but inspired by the work of Petz.
