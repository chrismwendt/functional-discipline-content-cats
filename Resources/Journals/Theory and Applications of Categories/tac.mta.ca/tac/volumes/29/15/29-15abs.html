Topological functors as total categories

<p> 

A notion of central importance in categorical topology is that of
topological functor.  A faithful functor $\cal E \to \cal B$ is called
topological if it admits cartesian liftings of all (possibly large)  
families of arrows; the basic example is the forgetful functor $Top \to
Set$. A topological functor $\cal E \to 1$ is the same thing as a (large)
complete preorder, and the general topological functor $\cal E \to \cal B$
is intuitively thought of as a "complete preorder relative to $\cal B$".
We make this intuition precise by considering an enrichment base $\cal
Q_\cal B$ such that $\cal Q_\cal B$-enriched categories are faithful
functors into $\cal B$, and show that, in this context, a faithful functor
is topological if and only if it is total (=totally cocomplete) in the
sense of Street-Walters. We also consider the MacNeille completion of a
faithful functor to a topological one, first described by Herrlich, and
show that it may be obtained as an instance of Isbell's generalised notion
of MacNeille completion for enriched categories.
