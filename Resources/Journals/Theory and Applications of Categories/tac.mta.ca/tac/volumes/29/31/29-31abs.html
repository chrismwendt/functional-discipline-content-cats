Given a monad $T$ on a suitable enriched category $B$ equipped with a
proper factorization system $(E,M)$, we define notions of
<i>$T$-completion, $T$-closure</i>, and <i>$T$-density</i>.  We show that
not only the familiar notions of completion, closure, and density in
normed vector spaces, but also the notions of sheafification, closure, and
density with respect to a Lawvere-Tierney topology, are instances of the
given abstract notions.  The process of $T$-completion is equally the
enriched idempotent monad associated to $T$ (which we call the
<i>idempotent core of $T$)</i>, and we show that it exists as soon as
every morphism in $B$ factors as a $T$-dense morphism followed by a
$T$-closed $M$-embedding.  The latter hypothesis is satisfied as soon as
$B$ has certain pullbacks as well as wide intersections of $M$-embeddings.  
Hence the resulting theorem on the existence of the idempotent core of an
enriched monad entails Fakir's existence result in the non-enriched case,
as well as adjoint functor factorization results of Applegate-Tierney and
Day.
