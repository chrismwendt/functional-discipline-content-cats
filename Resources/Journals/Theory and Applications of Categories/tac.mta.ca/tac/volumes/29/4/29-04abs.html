<h1>
Obvious natural morphisms of sheaves are unique

<p> 

We prove that a large class of natural transformations (consisting
  roughly of those constructed via composition from the ``functorial''
  or ``base change'' transformations) between two functors of the form
  $... f^* g_* ...$ actually has only one element, and thus that
  any diagram of such maps necessarily commutes.  We identify the
  precise axioms defining what we call a ``geofibered category'' that
  ensure that such a coherence theorem exists.  Our results apply to
  all the usual sheaf-theoretic contexts of algebraic geometry.  The
  analogous result that would include any other of the six functors
  remains unknown.
