<p> 

The aim of this series of papers is to develop a self-dual categorical
approach to some topics in non-abelian algebra, which is based on
replacing the framework of a category with that of a category equipped
with a functor to it. The present paper gives some preliminary steps in
this direction, where several known structures on a category, which arise
in the categorical treatment of these topics, are viewed as such functors;
as a result, we obtain some new conceptual links between these structures.
