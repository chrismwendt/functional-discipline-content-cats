<h1> 
Category theory for genetics I:mutations and sequence alignments

The present article is the first of a series whose goal is to define a
logical formalism in which it is possible to reason about genetics. In
this paper, we introduce the main concepts of our language whose
domain of discourse consists of a class of limit-sketches and their
associated models. While our program will aim to show that different
phenomena of genetics can be modeled by changing the category in which
the models take their values, in this paper, we study models in the
category of sets to capture mutation mechanisms such as insertions,
deletions, substitutions, duplications and inversions. We show how the
proposed formalism can be used for constructing multiple sequence
alignments with an emphasis on mutation mechanisms.
