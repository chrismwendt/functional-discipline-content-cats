Revisiting the canonicity of canonical triangulations

<p> 

Stable derivators provide an enhancement of triangulated categories as is
indicated by the existence of canonical triangulations. In this paper we
show that exact morphisms of stable derivators induce exact functors of
canonical triangulations, and similarly for arbitrary natural
transformations. This 2-categorical refinement also provides a
uniqueness statement concerning canonical triangulations.
</p>

<p> 
These results rely on a more careful study of morphisms of derivators and
this study is of independent interest. We analyze the interaction of
morphisms of derivators with limits, colimits, and Kan extensions,
including a discussion of invariance and closure properties of the class
of Kan extensions preserved by a fixed morphism.
