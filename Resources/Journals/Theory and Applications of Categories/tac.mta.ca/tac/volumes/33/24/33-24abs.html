Spheres as Frobenius objects

Following the pattern of the Frobenius structure usually assigned to the
1-dimensional sphere, we investigate the Frobenius structures of spheres
in all other dimensions. Starting from dimension d=1, all the spheres are
commutative Frobenius objects in categories whose arrows are
(d+1)-dimensional cobordisms. With respect to the language of Frobenius
objects, there is no distinction between these spheres - they are all free
of additional equations formulated in this language. The corresponding
structure makes out of the 0-dimensional sphere not a commutative but a
symmetric Frobenius object. This sphere is mapped to a matrix Frobenius
algebra by a 1-dimensional topological quantum field theory, which
corresponds to the representation of a class of diagrammatic algebras
given by Richard Brauer.
