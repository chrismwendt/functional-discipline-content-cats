Quantum categories have been recently studied because of their relation to
bialgebroids, small categories, and skew monoidales. This is the first of
a series of papers based on the author's PhD thesis in which we examine
the theory of quantum categories developed by Day, Lack, and Street.

A quantum category is an opmonoidal monad on the monoidale associated to a
biduality $R\dashv R^{o}$, or enveloping monoidale, in a monoidal
bicategory of modules $\Mod(V})$ for a monoidal category
$V$. Lack and Street proved that quantum categories are in
equivalence with right skew monoidales whose unit has a right adjoint in
$\Mod(V)$. Our first important result is similar to that of Lack
and Street. It is a characterisation of opmonoidal <i>arrows</i> on
enveloping monoidales in terms of a new structure named <i>oplax
action</i>. We then provide three different notions of comodule for an
opmonoidal arrow, and using a similar technique we prove that they are
equivalent. Finally, when the opmonoidal arrow is an opmonoidal monad, we
are able to provide the category of comodules for a quantum category with
a monoidal structure such that the forgetful functor is monoidal.
