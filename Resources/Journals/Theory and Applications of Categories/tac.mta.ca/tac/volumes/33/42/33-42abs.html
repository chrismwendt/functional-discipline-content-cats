We consider Toeplitz and Cuntz-Krieger $C^*$-algebras associated with
fin\-itely aligned left cancellative small categories. We pay special
attention to the case where such a category arises as the Zappa-Szep
product of a category and a group linked by a one-cocycle. As our main
application, we obtain a new approach to Exel-Pardo algebras in the case
of row-finite graphs. We also present some other ways of constructing
$C^*$-algebras from left cancellative small categories and discuss their
relationship.
