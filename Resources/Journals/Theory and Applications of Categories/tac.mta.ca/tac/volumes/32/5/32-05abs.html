Bourn-normal monomorphisms in regular Mal'tsev categories

Normal monomorphisms in the sense of Bourn describe the equivalence
classes of an internal equivalence relation. Although the definition is
given in the fairly general setting of a category with finite limits,
later investigations on this subject often focus on protomodular settings,
where normality becomes a property. This paper clarifies the connections
between internal equivalence relations and Bourn-normal monomorphisms in
regular Mal'tesv categories with pushouts of split monomorphisms along
arbitrary morphisms, whereas a full description is achieved for
quasi-pointed regular Mal'tsev categories with pushouts of split
monomorphisms along arbitrary morphisms.
