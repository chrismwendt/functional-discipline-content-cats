Classifying tangent structures using Weil algebras

At the heart of differential geometry is the construction of the tangent
bundle of a manifold. There are various abstractions of this construction,
and of particular interest here is that of Tangent Structures. Tangent
Structure is defined via giving an underlying category M and a tangent
functor T along with a list of natural transformations satisfying a set of
axioms, then detailing the behaviour of T in the category End(M). However,
this axiomatic definition at first seems somewhat disjoint from other
approaches in differential geometry. The aim of this paper is to present a
perspective that addresses this issue. More specifically, this paper
highlights a very explicit relationship between the axiomatic definition
of Tangent Structure and the Weil algebras (which have a well established
place in differential geometry).
