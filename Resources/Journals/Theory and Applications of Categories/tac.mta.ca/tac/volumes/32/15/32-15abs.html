<p> 

On a category $\mathscr{C}$ with a designated (well-behaved) class
$\mathcal{M}$ of monomorphisms, a closure operator in the sense of
D.~Dikranjan and E.~Giuli is a pointed endofunctor of $\mathcal{M}$, seen
as a full subcategory of the arrow-category $\mathscr{C}^\mathbf{2}$ whose
objects are morphisms from the class $\mathcal{M}$, which ``commutes''
with the codomain functor $\mathsf{cod}\colon \mathcal{M}\to \mathscr{C}$.
In other words, a closure operator consists of a functor $C\colon
\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}$ and a natural transformation $c\colon
1_\mathcal{M}\to C$ such that $\mathsf{cod} \cdot C=C$ and
$\mathsf{cod}\cdot c=1_\mathsf{cod}$. In this paper we adapt this notion
to the domain functor $\mathsf{dom}\colon \mathcal{E}\to\mathscr{C}$,
where $\mathcal{E}$ is a class of epimorphisms in $\mathscr{C}$, and show
that such closure operators can be used to classify
$\mathcal{E}$-epireflective subcategories of $\mathscr{C}$, provided
$\mathcal{E}$ is closed under composition and contains isomorphisms.
