<h1> 
KZ-monadic categories and their logic

<p> 

Given an order-enriched category, it is known that all its KZ-monadic
subcategories can be described by Kan-injectivity with respect to a
collection of morphisms. We prove the analogous result for Kan-injectivity
with respect to a collection H of commutative squares. A square is called
a Kan-injective consequence of H if by adding it to H Kan-injectivity is
not changed.

We present a sound logic for Kan-injectivity consequences and prove that
in ``reasonable"  categories (such as $\Pos$ or $\Top_0$)
 it is also complete for every set H of  squares.
