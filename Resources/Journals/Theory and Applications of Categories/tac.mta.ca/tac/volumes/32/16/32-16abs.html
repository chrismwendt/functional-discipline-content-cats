Databases have been studied category-theoretically for decades. While
mathematically elegant, previous categorical models have typically
struggled withrepresenting concrete data such as integers or strings.

In the present work, we propose an extension of the earlier set-valued
functor model, making use of multi-sorted algebraic theories (a.k.a.
Lawvere theories) to incorporate concrete data in a principled way. This
approach easily handles missing information (null values), and also allows
constraints and queries to make use of operations on data, such as
multiplication or comparison of numbers, helping to bridge the gap between
traditional databases and programming languages.

We also show how all of the components of our model - including schemas,
instances, change-of-schema functors, and queries fit into a single double
categorical structure called a proarrow equipment (a.k.a.  framed
bicategory).
