Localization of enriched categories and cubical sets

<p> 

The invertibility hypothesis for a monoidal model category S asks that
localizing an S-enriched category with respect to an equivalence results
in an weakly equivalent enriched category. This is the most technical
among the axioms for S to be an <i>excellent model category</i> in the
sense of Lurie, who showed that the category Cat_S of S-enriched
categories then has a model structure with characterizable fibrant
objects. We use a universal property of cubical sets, as a monoidal model
category, to show that the invertibility hypothesis is a consequence of
the other axioms.
