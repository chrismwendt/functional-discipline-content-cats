A property of effectivization and its uses in categorical logic

<p> 

We show that a fully faithful and covering regular functor between
regular categories induces a fully faithful (and covering) functor
between their respective effectivizations. Such a functor between
effective categories is known to be an equivalence. We exploit this
result in order to give a constructive proof of conceptual
completeness for regular logic. We also use it in analyzing what it
means for a morphism between effective categories to be a quotient
in the 2-category of effective categories and regular functors
between them.
