As we all know, the complete lattice I_D(S) of all D-ideals of a
meet-semilattice S is precisely the injective hull of S in the category of
meet-semilattices. In this paper, we consider sm-ideals of posemigroups
which can be regarded as a generalization of D-ideals of
meet-semilattices. Unfortunately, the quantale R(S) of all sm-ideals of a
posemigroup S is in general not an injective hull of S. However, R(S) can
be seen as a new type of quantale completions of S. Further, we can see
that R(S) is also a free object over S in the category PoSgr_v of
posemigroups with sm-distributive join homomorphisms.
