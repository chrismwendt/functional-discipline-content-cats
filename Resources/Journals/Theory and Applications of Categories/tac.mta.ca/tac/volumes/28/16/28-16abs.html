<h1>
Bounded Archimedean l-algebras and Gelfand-Neumark-Stone duality
</h1><h2>

<p>

By Gelfand-Neumark duality, the category $C^*Alg$
of commutative $C^*$-algebras is dually equivalent to the category of
compact Hausdorff spaces, which by Stone duality, is also dually
equivalent to the category $ubal$ of uniformly complete bounded
Archimedean $\ell$-algebras.  Consequently, $C^*Alg$ is equivalent
to $ubal$, and this equivalence can be described through
complexification.

<p>
In this article we study $ubal$ within the larger category $bal$ of
bounded Archimedean $\ell$-algebras.  We show that $ubal$ is the
smallest nontrivial reflective subcategory of $bal$, and that $ubal$
consists of exactly those objects in $bal$ that are epicomplete, a fact
that includes a categorical formulation of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem
for $bal$.  It follows that $ubal$ is the unique nontrivial reflective
epicomplete subcategory of $bal$.  We also show that each nontrivial
reflective subcategory of $bal$ is both monoreflective and
epireflective, and exhibit two other interesting reflective
subcategories of $bal$ involving Gelfand rings and square closed rings.

<p>
Dually, we show that Specker ${\mathbb R}$-algebras are precisely the
co-epicomplete objects in $bal$.  We prove that the category $spec$ of
Specker $\mathbb R$-algebras is a mono-coreflective subcategory of
$bal$ that is co-epireflective in a mono-coreflective subcategory of
$bal$ consisting of what we term $\ell$-clean rings, a version of clean
rings adapted to the order-theoretic setting of $bal$.

<p>
We conclude the article by discussing the import of our results in the
setting of complex $*$-algebras through complexification.
