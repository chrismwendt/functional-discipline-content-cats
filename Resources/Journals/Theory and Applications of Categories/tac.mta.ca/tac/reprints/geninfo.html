SELECTION OF REPRINTS
</a>
</h2>

<ol>
<li> After obtaining written permission from any copyright holder, any three
TAC Editors may propose a work for TAC Reprints to the Managing Editor.
The proposal will be reported to all Editors.
</li>
<li> 
The Managing Editor may either accept the proposal or require that the
Editors vote on it. Before such a vote, the author, title and original
publication data will be circulated to Editors. If a 2/3 majority of those
TAC Editors responding within one month agrees, the work will be accepted
for TAC Reprints.
</li>
<li> 
After a work is accepted, the author or proposer must provide to TAC
either a usable TeX source or a PDF document acceptable to the Managing
Editor that reproduces a typeset version. Up to five pages of corrections,
commentary and forward pointers may be appended by the author.
</ol>

<p>
When submitting commentary, authors should read and follow the
