This is a LaTeX 2.09 document, but it contains \usepackage.
If you want to use the new features of LaTeX2e, your document
should begin with \documentclass rather than \documentstyle
! LaTeX Error: \usepackage before \documentclass.
See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
l. ...\usepackage{
                 latexsym}
\usepackage may only appear in the document preamble, i.e.,
between \documentclass and \begin{document}.
