## required – Packages "required" of a LaTeX distribution

These are packages that the LaTeX team have declared are "required" of any LaTeX distribution in the sense that any package writer is entitled to assume the presence of these packages in support of her package.

All bundles are supported by members of the LaTeX team and bug report can be opened for them using the [Issue Tracker for LaTeX2e on GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues).

The set comprises:

 - `amsmath`: mathematical support from the AMS (these days maintained by the LaTeX team);
 - `cyrillic`: Standard LaTeX support for using Cyrillic alphabet fonts;
 - `graphics`: The standard LaTeX graphics and colour packages; and
 - `tools`: Basic LaTeX tools.

Also part of the "required" set of bundles is

 - `babel`: The babel package for multilingual typesetting.

However, it has its own Github repository and any bug report concerning babel should be opened at the [Issue Tracker for Babel on GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/babel/issues).

In the past there have been two further bundles:

 -  `psnfss`: Basic support for using common Adobe Type 1 fonts with LaTeX—the “psnfss”; and
 -  `mfnfss`: some Metafont font support files

but these are no longer maintained by the Team and any issue with them should be reported according to the information given in those bundles.
